    You've followed a link we didn't code yet!
    Head back to the
    <a href="/">Main Page</a>.

  <p>
    One day a developer came along and gave us
    this website then disappeared into the
    mist.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another developer came and cleaned it up,
    making the website functional and
    navigationable for the 2009 emulation's
    purposes - but links are missing and
    broken all over the place!
  </p>

  <p>
    So where does that leave us (and you?) -
    Well, if you're just here to play the
    game, head to our main page and hop on! If
    you want to help fix our little problem,
    read on!
  </p>

  <p>
    We actually have all the pages, they just
    need their links fixed. If you're a
    developer and want to help fix this, clone
    our website repository from
    <a href="https://github.com/2009scape/">GitHub</a>
    and open title.html - you'll notice
    something a little special, but more
    importantly, you'll notice all the links
    work ;). We need your help making
    index.html link to all the right places!
