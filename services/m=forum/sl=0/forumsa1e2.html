<a name="ONE"</a>1.	I sent my SMS and haven�t received a PIN. <br> <br><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="yellow"> For a direct response from our billing team, please send an email to billingsupport@jagex.com. </font> <br> <br>First of all, check that none of the following apply. These are all common reasons for failure of the PayBySMS service: <br> <br>�	Your network provider blocks inbound premium rate text messages. <br>�	There was not enough money on your mobile phone to pay for a full month of membership. <br>�	Your text message inbox was full meaning the message could not be delivered. <br>�	Your mobile phone service provider was unable to send the PIN due to loss of service. <br>�	You are using a network provider that does not accept PayBySMS <br> <br>Any of these can result in failure to process the payment entirely. You will not be charged by us for a failed payment, but you may receive a charge from your network provider for the text, so be sure to check before sending your text that none of the above points  apply. <br> <br> <br>If you have successfully initiated the process but are experiencing delays in receiving part of the message containing your PIN, ensure that none of these points apply: <br> <br>�	Your mobile phone service provider was unable to send the PIN for a few days due to loss of service. <br>�	The phone network is busy. <br>�	Your inbox is full. <br>�	There is no signal for the PIN to be transmitted to your phone. <br>�	You did not have enough credit to cover both halves of the PIN. <br> <br>If you have eliminated all of the above and have not received a PIN within 72 hours, contact support@surfpin.com for further assistance.

<a name="TWO"</a>2.	I subscribed by phone/SMS and received fewer days than I should have. <br> <br><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="yellow"> For a direct response from our billing team, please send an email to billingsupport@jagex.com. </font> <br> <br>Surfpin provide different numbers to call or send your text to depending on where you are, which product you are subscribing to and whether or not you are eligible for our discount rate. This issue is usually caused by calling the number meant for those eligible for the discount and then applying the PIN to an account which is not.  <br> <br>When this happens, our system detects that you have not paid enough and gives you a proportionally reduced number of days. <br>  <br>To prevent this, make sure that each time you subscribe to Surfpin you log in with the account that you wish to pay for and complete the subscription process in its entirety. This will ensure that you have the right number for your account. <br>If you are sure that you have called the right number, please contact us at <i>billingsupport@jagex.com</i> so we can look further into the matter.

<a name="THREE"</a>3.	You charged me more than once for my subscription! <br> <br><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="yellow"> For a direct response from our billing team, please send an email to billingsupport@jagex.com. </font> <br> <br>We will only ever charge you once for a single payment attempt made. There can be a number of reasons that too many charges seem to have been made: <br> <br>-	<u>Your bank puts more than one entry on your credit card statement for a single payment</u> � Some banks will list both the date on which they authorised the payment and the day on which the funds actually left the account. <br>-	<u>Some of your credit card payment attempts have been declined by our fraud prevention system.</u> � If you have failed to make a successful credit card payment, perhaps by making a mistake when entering your details, then your bank may still set aside the funds for transfer. We will not accept these, however, and they should be returned to you in 5-10 working days. <br>-	<u>There are several accounts subscribed from your details</u> � There may be other subscriptions running from your card. You may simply have forgotten about this or an agreement may have been started by somebody else with access to your financial details. Check with any younger family members or joint cardholders. <br> <br>If none of the above suggestions apply, contact us at <i>billingsupport@jagex.com</i> and we will investigate the matter fully.

<a name="FIVE"</a>5.	I tried to log in and was told that my account had been �disabled�. What does this mean and what do I do? <br> <br><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="yellow"> For a direct response from our billing team, please send an email to billingsupport@jagex.com. </font> <br> <br>If your account has been �disabled� then it has been rendered inaccessible because a payment has been disputed by the person responsible for paying the bill. When this happens the relevant billing partner charges us for the cost of the membership as well as additional administrative costs. We then take an equivalent amount in credit from that already on your account. If there is not enough on your account to cover the deduction your account will go into negative balance, becoming unusable until the negative amount is repaid to us. <br> <br>-	The first thing to do is to contact the person responsible for paying for the membership. Depending on whether the dispute is still at an investigatory stage it may be possible to reverse the dispute. Sometimes when a non-player subscribes for a family member disputes are made by mistake when they do not recognise our payments. <br>-	If this is not an option you will have to repay the amount owed before access will be granted to your account once more.  This is not a debt and you are not obliged to pay, but you cannot regain access to your account unless you do. <br>-	To see how much negative credit is on your account, log in <a href=../../../secure/m%3dweblogin/loginformc57d.html?mod=billing_core&amp;ssl=1&amp;expired=0&amp;dest=userdetails.ws>here</a>.  <br>-	To make your repayment log in <a href=../../../secure/m%3dweblogin/members/members.html>here</a>, selecting �Subscribe without credit card� and an amount sufficient to repay the amount of negative balance on your account.  <br>-	Any excess will be added to your account as member�s credit.

<a name="SIX"</a>6.	Can we have new payment methods in my country? <br> <br><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="yellow"> For a direct response from our billing team, please send an email to billingsupport@jagex.com. </font> <br> <br>We would love nothing more than to offer every payment method in every country.  We are constantly at work with our billing partners to provide as many options for payment for as many people across the world as we can. <br> <br>These things take a lot of time and organization, however. First our billing partners have to see if they can realistically make the arrangements to provide their payment method in the new area in question. Then we have to decide if it makes sense to bring the method to the new area in comparison to others and take into account innumerable other factors that can emerge.  <br> <br>We can�t say when we�ll introduce your desired payment method in your area, I�m afraid. However, rest assured that we will announce it via site as soon as we have news of any changes.

<a name="SEVEN"</a>7.	I�ve been hijacked/banned. Can I have a refund? <br> <br><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="yellow"> For a direct response from our billing team, please send an email to billingsupport@jagex.com. </font> <br> <br>In either case the answer is no, I�m afraid.  <br> <br>It is impossible to �hack� a RuneScape account, so the only way that a malicious user can gain access to another�s account is to persuade or trick them into revealing their details. We offer ample <a href=../../../site/kbase/guid/security_information.html?article_id=2087>Security Advice</a> on how to avoid this entirely. While we can offer such information and will help in any way that we can, account security is ultimately the responsibility of the user him/herself. <br> <br>If you have been banned then it will be because you have broken one or more of our <a href=../../../site/kbase/guid/rules_of_conduct.html?guid=rules_of_conduct>Rules of Conduct</a>. Abiding by these is one of the <a href=../../../site/terms/terms.html>Terms & Conditions</a> of membership, so any time lost is forfeit as you have chosen to breach the terms of our agreement.  <br> <br>You have a chance to appeal the offence causing your permanent ban. If this is declined, however, then we have concluded that the offence was committed and that the account's owner was in control at the time, so our decision will not change.  <br> <br>Any agreements on which payment is due when an account is locked or permanently banned will be cancelled automatically. You may also cancel an agreement even without logging into an account by selecting the �cancel by card� option on the cancellation screen.

<a name="EIGHT"</a>8.	Why did you charge me again? I only authorised you to take one month�s payment from my credit card. <br> <br><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="yellow"> For a direct response from our billing team, please send an email to billingsupport@jagex.com. </font> <br> <br>We do not currently offer the option to make a stand-alone payment for a single month�s membership via credit card. All credit card payments are part of an ongoing subscription agreement in which the designated card is charged once a month until the agreement is terminated. This is clearly stated during the <a href=../../../secure/m%3dweblogin/members/members.html>subscription process</a> and in the <a href=../../../site/terms/terms.html>Terms & Conditions</a> that you are required to agree to upon establishment of your subscription. <br> <br>As is also stated in the Terms & Conditions you are free to cancel an agreement at any time. Should you wish to do so, you are free to cancel your subscription shortly after your first payment is taken.  As long as you cancel 4 days or more before the credit on your account is due to expire, no further payments will be taken.

<a name="NINE"</a>9.	Why doesn�t my pre-paid card work? <br> <br><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR="yellow"> For a direct response from our billing team, please send an email to billingsupport@jagex.com. </font> <br> <br>There are several types of pre-paid card available, which can be divided into 2 groups: <br> <br>-	<b>Gift Cards</b>:   These are available worldwide. They are available in various forms, but are all essentially the same thing; credit cards with a small, pre-set amount of balance available to them designed to be given as gifts.  <br> <br>The problem with these is that they can be used, just like a credit card, to buy anything and are not designed specifically for RuneScape membership. The first thing you should do is to check the back of the card. If there is an indication that you will not be able to make a payment to the UK with your card (e.g. the card says �Usable only in the United States�) then any payment attempts will fail. In addition, all rules that apply to credit card payments apply to gift cards, so only Visa, Visa Delta and Mastercard are usable. American Express Gift Cards are not usable at present. Finally, you should remember that you are entering into an ongoing subscription agreement with a card that has only a certain amount of balance available, so you should be sure to cancel your agreement before this runs out. <br> <br>Even with all this in mind, all gift cards are different and not all can be used with our billing system. If in doubt, contact the card�s manufacturer for more information. <br> <br>-	<b>RuneScape-Specific Game Cards</b>: These are cards manufactured by companies who specialise in creating convenient payment methods for online game subscriptions. They are available in selected game and convenience stores. They work by providing the user with a PIN number which can be entered into our website, adding the credit to your account. The main types are as follows: <br> <br><a href=../../../site/kbase/guid/voucher_payment.html?article_id=814>RuneScape Game Cards</a>: These are made for us by a company called <a href="http://www.incomm.com/">InComm</a>. They are available in the United States at selected Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven, Rite Aid and Target stores and come in 30 ($7.95) and 90 ($22.50) day varieties. They may also be purchased in the UK in Sainsburys and WH Smiths, also in 30 (�4.99) and 90 (�12.99) day varieties.  You may redeem one of these via the �Subscribe with RuneScape Card� option. <br><a href=../../../site/kbase/guid/paybycash_paymenthtml.html?article_id=2767>Ultimate Game Cards</a>:  These are one of the many payment options offered by PayByCash. They are available at various locations across the world as detailed <a href="http://www.ultimategamecard.com/retailers.php">here</a>, but are most commonly used in the United States and Canada. Ultimate Game Cards come in $10 and $20 varieties. The nice thing about them is that up to five of these cards can be used to contribute toward a single payment. You can also use any leftover credit on a card toward a future payment. Ultimate Game Cards are redeemed via the �Subscribe without Credit Card� option in our subscription process. <br><a href=../../../site/kbase/guid/wallie_card_payment.html?article_id=774>Wallie Cards</a>: These are widely available in the European Union and Mexico. You can find a nearby retailer by visiting Wallie�s <a href="http://www.wallie.com/">website</a> and selecting your country from the list. Each regional site includes a search engine which will allow you to find your nearest stockist. You may either purchase a card in-store or use a printable voucher as described on the website. Like Ultimate Game Cards, a single Wallie card can be used across several payments or several cards used for a single payment. <br> <br>Any of these cards are an excellent way to give RuneScape membership to a friend as a gift. Just remember that you should give the card itself to your friend so that they may redeem the PIN for him/herself and that the cards should only be used in the country in which they were purchased.
