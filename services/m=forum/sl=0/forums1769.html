<div class="msgcontents">

Step 1: City of Danynt  <br> <br>I don't like introduction dialogue. But nonetheless, Arianwyn takes you to the entrance of a new place. What used to be known as the under-city of Prifddinas is really known as Danynt. At least it has a name. It's basically a large, rectangular room. Yea.  <br> <br>In the center it's kind of octagon shaped, but still the same room. Next to each vertex of the octagon is a statue made out of nothing but crystal. Two of the statues are of Lord Iorwerth and King Baxtorian, with the remaining six as other elves. You can probably guess that they are the 8 Elven Clan Leaders. In the center of the statues is a crystal spiral stairway. On the west and east faces of the Octagon are doors leading into other room. At the south end of the main room is another, larger door in the shape of an octagon. This larger door has 8 crystal seals around its inner vertexes and one in the center, all illuminated except for the top left one which has a crack through it.  <br> <br>You will find Arianwyn in the room center. You will talk to him. Arianwyn will tell you how Prifddinas is directly above you, but not to go just yet. You need a disguise. He will give you 3 chrisial seeds.  <br> <br>The focus is on the west and east face rooms. The room to the east is sealed behind a crystal door, regular sized. The room to the west has no door. Let's go that way.  <br> <br>Note: Make sure you have a charged Teleport Crystal for Lletya, teleports to various areas, and coins to charge the crystal again.  <br> <br>You head into the west room. In it are 3 Chrisial Patches, which each require a single chrisial seed and 68 farming (to be listed in the Special tab for farming). Teclyn will be nearby for you to exchange tools. The tree you plant will not be affected by disease. Although, when you attempt to water it you find yourself unable to. Ask Teclyn and he will say to find a grand farmer.

Step 2: Look-a-Like  <br> <br>This is the time to find Martin in Draynor. When talking, he doesn�t believe a tree can be of crystal and jokingly says �Why not try to water it with crystal water?� This is actually what you�ll do. Not that much of a challenge, just get some Crushed Gem and add it to your Watering Can. Now you can water the Chrisial Trees.  <br> <br>Note: Bring a hatchet.  <br>You wait. You wait. You wait� Your tree finishes growing. The first thing you can do is Harvest it, which will yield one more Chrisial Seed. Then you will get the option to cut it down. Cutting down this tree will yield five Chrisial Branches. I�m thinking, to spike the requirements, to have the Chrisial Branches only able to be forged at the Dragon Forge. Makes sense since crystal has a very high melting point, and it�s not metal so the anvils won�t resist it. This takes 68 smithing.  <br> <br>Every 5 branches make a Chrisial Bar, and it takes 3 bars to make the Chrisial Pike that you need. Yes, you went back and forth that much for a Pike. Now, to get the rest of the outfit.  <br> <br>Head toward the Elf Camp where Iorwerth was. He is no longer there. Kill some Elf Warriors until you have the Elven Helm, Elven Platebody, and Elven Platelegs. Get a pair of Barrows Gloves from the Calinaromancer�s chest and bring your Crystal Pendent. If you lost yours, Arianwyn will give you another along with the Elven boots.  <br> <br>Lastly, with the help of level 70 crafting, use soft clay on any of the elven statues in Danynt to make a set of Elf Ears for yourself. Use these on the elven helm to attach them, and then equip it. Now, if wearing all your elf wear, you can walk up the crystal stairway to Prifddinas.

Step 3: Opening the Doors  <br> <br>As you saw from outside, Prifddinas is a big octagon made of crystal. Upon entering, a cut scene intervenes. It shows a pan of the city. Every aspect of Prifddinas is crystalline. In the center a large tower, which you can guess is the Tower of Voices. The doors are sealed though. There�s not much yet the way NPCs go. Each of the 8 outer towers has something. General Store, Bank, a Chaos Altar, Mini Obelisk, and a Water Source. The other towers will be made use of later on.  <br> <br>The small shack that leads to Danynt is near the north wall, just out of site from the world map. The path leading north is blocked by fallen rocks from the mountain next door.  <br> <br>There are a few NPCs walking around that you just talk to. Their names are: Caeth, N�Dlawd, N�Egwan, and Fforia. Upon speaking with the first three you will learn that they are under a tyrannous rule of Iorwerth. Fforia is just one of those �the world�s ending� sort of Elf exclaiming of the Dark Lord. She doesn�t seem to notice you talking to her. Next you will talk with Choel, the priest Elf by the altar.  <br> <br>Choel first talks about how he can tell you are trying to help. He will confide upon you how he is not part of the Iorwerth Clan at all, but everyone thinks otherwise. He can help, but not give it out. Thus, a riddle he gives:  <br> <br>The loftiest cedars I can eat,  <br>Yet neither paunch nor mouth have I,  <br>I storm whene'er you give me meat,  <br>Whene'er you give me drink I die.  <br>Wave to me when you know of me  <br>That tower door shall be no more.  <br> <br>So now use Fire Wave on the Tower of Voice�s door. The seal will break, but your efforts are useless. When you try and enter an army of Elf Warriors will send outside the main gate to Prifddinas. Head back to Arianwyn, who tells you to recruit an army.

Step 4: Recruiting Army Part B  <br> <br>The last recruitment is King Awowogei, Monkey King. Even though he seems to only be joking about helping you, actually getting this for him makes him go crazy for the idea of helping you. This section is going to take much traversing across Runescape. When talking to Awowogei, he wants a basket of the most delicious fruits in the lands. You will first need a special fruit basket. In order to do this you need to start with special compost. Use a hammer on a Gold Bar to smash it, and use the remains with Pestle and Mortar to grind it. Fill a compost bin with weeds and use the Ground Gold with it before closing it. Use the resulting compost on a patch for Poison Ivy. While it grows, you will need a potion from the Apothecary to make the Poison Ivy harmless.  <br> <br>He will tell you the procedure, which is as follows. Make or buy a Super Anti Poison (3 or 4). Add this to a Super Restore Potion of the same dosage. Let the resultant mixture ferment for about a minute until you get a message telling you that it�s ready. The Apothecary will give you a final �secret ingredient� (for the small price of 5k) that will finish the potion: Ivy Cure (3). Use the Ivy Cure on your Poison Ivy when it�s finished growing. Use a hatchet or machete on the crop after checking its health to get Ivy Vines. Use it on a weaver�s loom for the Ivy Basket to place the fruit in.  <br> <br>Now for the first fruit: Golden Apple. Previously unobtainable, now has a use. Get a Raven (or any bird pet) and go to the Golden Apple Tree near Lalli the Troll. Prepare for battle, by the way. Right click the tree and select �Fetch�. While your Bird is in the air with an apple, Lalli will attack. When he gets to red, he will fall unconscious and you will get your apple. He is no laughing matter when he fights. <br> <br> <br>Note: Players can talk to the Cook in Lumbridge about Great Fruit during the quest to tell where they are.

Step 5: Judgment  <br> <br>Once these are complete, use the God Grapes upon the basket to get the finished product. Take it to that monkey guy. He will join your cause, and you will (yet again) report to Arianwyn. Warning: The next time you go into Prifddinas you will be sent into fierce battle. You will see various forces within the Tower of Voices fighting Elf Warriors, while three warriors (lvl108) are guarding the stairs. KILL THEM!  <br> <br>Once the three Elf Warriors are slain, proceed up the stairs. This is where you must defeat the four beasts consecutively. Each room looks exactly the same. Once you enter one, the stairs disappear and the exit stairs appear once you defeat a beast. Each room has a picture of a flaming horse (think ghost Rider here, except better) on one wall. Each beast is a humanoid looking creature.  <br> <br>The first beast is named Bla. He is a master of Ranged attacks with a bow and arrow. He will always be 10 levels above the player. Immune to poison.  <br> <br>The second beast is named Rhyfela. He is a master of the Sword. He will always be 15-20 levels above the player. Immune to stat change and hold spells.  <br> <br>The third beast is named Newyn. He is the master of mixed combat and will use Ranged, Melee, and Magic (not much magic though). He will always be 20-25 levels above the player. Immune to stat change, hold spells, and poisons.  <br> <br>The last beast is named Addoed. He is a master of magic and will attack with a distribution of surge spells. He will always be 30 levels above the player and will use prayers for magic or melee, as he needs not ranged since ranged attacks won*t effect him much.

Step 6: Dark Crystal  <br> <br>Once the Four Beasts are killed, the player finds himself on the ground floor again. All the Elf Warriors are defeated and the armies you recruited will be helping the injured and whatnot. Another stairway will reveal itself, which will take you to Lord Iorwerth when ready.  <br> <br>Lord Iorwerth is a great opponent. Lord Iorwerth is an unbelievable level 673, being that he has had such a long life to train during. If you try to safe-spot Iorwerth, he will switch to a better Crystal Bow that will hit through prayer, so it�s better just to melee him. He will in turn use Melee, still hitting through prayer but only at 60% damage.  <br>So you�ve defeated Iorwerth.  <br> <br>The end right? We�ve gone through most of the requirements�which isn�t all. Oh look, more to the quest.  <br>Cut scene will intervene. You and the recruited armies will be having a party. Meanwhile�in the under-city Danynt, we set our sights upon the sealed chamber across from the Chrisial Tree Patches. And in walks�the Wise Old Man from Draynor village? This will be the first dialogue I will make myself.  <br> <br>WOM: �Oh look, a pretty door. Let�s take a look inside, shall we?�  <br> <br>The Wise Old Man than casts a spell, a bright flash is seen and the door opens. Then the room suddenly gets a lot darker.  <br> <br>WOM: �Oops*I think that�s my cue to leave now** *runs away*  <br> <br>The scene goes back to the gathering in the Tower of Voices. The screen dramatically begins to shake. Pan out to a view of Prifddinas, covered in a black cloud and lightning. From the top of the Tower to the base of the city, all the crystal turned dark. Oh no!

Step 7: Book of Serenity  <br> <br>You then see Arianwyn calling and running into Danynt. Your character follows, only to see yourself in the empty sealed chamber. Arianwym talks about how it must be the Dark Lord. After talking around the camp, no one knows anything but you do notice that Fforia is missing.  <br> <br>Note: You can use the main entrance to Prifddinas now.  <br> <br>Checking outside you use your amazing powers of hunter. Track the footprints with your spade in your inventory until (after taking you through most of Isafdar) you find a mount. Dig it up, open a obtained chest, and find Fforia�s note. It�s coordinates. Using your watch and stuff, find it. You will keep following coordinated until they finally send you to Otto�s Grotto.  <br> <br>Tell her of the situation and she tells you about the Book of Serenity, described as you read along.  <br> <br>The book consists of five pages. The first are relatively easy to find. The first one can be found by searching Glarial�s tomb. The next is in the Waterfall Dungeon. Dig around where the rats are. The third is found at the newly abandoned Elf Camp by searching the bed in a tent. The fourth is in Zamouregal�s Fort. JaGeX, hide it somewhere good.  <br> <br>The last one is within the Legends Guild. Talk with Sir Radimus Erkle about the page and he will inform you that it's within the Legend Catacombs beneath the guild's dungeon. He will only take True Legends, meaning to go on you need at least 300 Quest Points. The screen will darken and you will appear in the catacombs.  <br> <br>To find the page you must traverse a room maze. Each room has portals to another, but in no specific order. There are challenging monsters in most of the room, all agressive, and few safe room. Just like the chaos tunnels. At the end you find a chamber with four coffins lining the west and east walls (decorative). Find the one with Sir Llyfr Meistr and the page will be within it.  <br> <br>Note: The portals are different for everyone but always remain the same for that person.

Step 8: Dark Lord  <br> <br>Go back to the Tower of Voices. Go up the stairs. PUZZLE ROOM. Remember those floor puzzles from Zelda a while back? You had to touch each floor space once before the next door opened. Let�s have a few of those. I�m not good with making puzzles, so I�m open for suggestions and JaGeX creativity. Once you reach the Lais Pinnacle (top of the Tower) you will see a beast made completely of Shadow. How dramatic, it�s the Dark Lord.  <br> <br>It will attack using Magic, Ranged, and Melee depending where you are. Prayer necessary. Stay up close and it will only Melee. Guess what? Level 809. Yea, powerful. But you only need to get it to half health really. You need to wield the book in order to deal damage, with a slayer level of 77.  <br> <br>Half way down his health, a flash of light from the book illuminates the area. Standing next to you, an Avatar of Stars. The Avatar will fight along side you until the Dark Lord is defeated. The crystals revert back to normal in the city. But strangely, you hear a voice:  <br> <br>Divine Voice: �I am glad there is a being such as yourself. I see that the wars are over and the city is in good hands now, thanks to you. Please, take these rewards. You have the blessings of the stars.�  <br> <br>Quest Complete!  <br> <br>Rewards:  <br>Access to Danynt and Prifddinas  <br>Access to the Grand Library under the blessing of the stars  <br>Access to the Legend Catacombs  <br>Ability to make Chrisial items (unknown during the quest, maybe have a miniquest teach this)  <br>Seren�s Bow and Shield (works just as Crystal Bow/Shield, charges and probably will have an agility level requirement) <br>New! Access to one of the White Dragon portals. <br>A lot of experience for the skills required for the quest.  <br>Quest Points  <br>I�m not good with rewards

After Quest Notes  <br>The names of the elves first seen in Prifddinas translate to Slave, except for Fforia whose name means Spy in Welsh.  <br> <br>The name of the priest, Choel, is translated from Welsh to mean Faith.  <br> <br>Like most names in this, Danynt is derived from the Welsh word for Beneath.  <br> <br>Llyfr Meistr is, of course, Welsh. It translates to &quot;Book Master&quot;, which could work for a future Legends' Guild quest as well. And it Rhymes!  <br> <br>It was already believed that the Wise Old Man had an idea of how to get into Prifddinas. Looks like he tried the wrong door.  <br> <br>Even though this seems to be the last quest, more quests still can be found from this. For example, why is Fforia named Spy? What�s beyond the north gate?  <br> <br>After the quest is completely finished, Prifddinas will flourish with elves. The eight outer towers will have access, along with many stores and a furnace able to work with crystal. Maybe a new quest start?  <br> <br>One of the new elves in Prifddinas, Arfod, will sell the player Seren Armour after the quest (or maybe another subquest afterward) seen at *thread was eaten by page 51 monster* <br> <br>The White Dragon Cave portal listed in the rewards is only open for use some of the time. It leads to the Distractions and Diversions of White Dragons. For moar detail, go to 241-242-736-61256431. <br> <br>New! June 24th: The Judgemental Beasts can be fought once a day for their drops after the part in the quest where you slay them. They each have a hidden chamber within the Stronghold of Security. <br>Rhyfela can be found on the first floor. <br>Newyn can be found on the second floor. <br>Bla can be found on the third floor. <br>Addoed can be found on the fourth floor. <br> <br>Chrisial Items: <br>Are available to be made after the quest. Each item needs the same amount of Chrisial Bars to make as the other versions of it.
