Welcome everyone to the Adopt a Writer Program!  <br> <br>This thread is designed to help out some of the newer, less experienced writers that visit these boards by pairing them up with one of the story forum's veterans. The available mentors will take those young padawans interested under their wings and help them grow and develop in their writing. These mentors would be a great resource by helping introduce their padawan to the story forum, showing them the ropes and how things work around here, answering any questions, and just being a source for feedback and criticism.  <br> <br>Now you might be wondering why you should get involved with this program?  <br> <br>Besides karma and the warm fuzzy feeling you get from helping others, by mentoring someone you're making it much more likely for that person to keep returning to the story forum and drawing them in as another friend and member of the community, thereby making this place more active which benefits everybody. And for padawans you have the opportunity to not only improve your writing, but get to meet and make friends with a lot of interesting people and get involved in this wonderful little community we have here.  <br> <br>Interested? Then keep on reading.  <br> <br> <br> <br>Table of Contents  <br> <br>Page 1  <br>Post 1: Introduction.

Potential Padawans:  <br> <br> <br>If you are interested in having someone mentor you, then all you have to do is fill out the application below.  <br> <br>Once accepted your name will be added to the list of potential adoptees, and you can then read through the list of mentors and ask for one of them to take you under their wing. Alternatively, you can hop around in front of the store window and wait for one of the mentors to choose you. Either way, once both parties agree the union will become official upon approval from one of the leaders.  <br> <br>Word of caution: any feedback given by your mentor is purely his/her opinion only. Whether accepting the feedback is your own choice.  <br> <br> <br> <br>Padawan Application:  <br> <br>User name/Nickname:  <br> <br>How long have you been on the forums?:  <br> <br>Do you have any current stories still alive on this forum, and if so could you provide a name and quickfind code?:  <br> <br>What are your goals and what are you looking for in your mentor?:  <br> <br>Do you promise to be respectful towards your mentor and all those on this thread?:  <br> <br>Is there anything else you would like to tell us about yourself, like your preferred genre of writing or about your personality? (For example, if you are a very outgoing person who is all over the place, it might not be the best match to pair yourself up with a very quiet, serious mentor):

Potential Mentors:  <br> <br> <br>When in comes to those interested in becoming a mentor, I am looking for 4 basic things:  <br> <br>1. You have to be a talented and knowledgeable author.  <br> <br>2. You have to have experience and know how things work around here. If the person you're mentoring asks a question like how do they get more readers on their story or where do they go for bios, and you don't know how to answer, then you're not helping them.  <br> <br>3. You have to be active. You're of no help if you're never online.  <br> <br>4. No jerks allowed. A mentor needs to be someone who's friendly and treats other people with respect. I don't care if you're the best writer on these boards. If you're just going to flame or insult your adopted writer whenever they ask you a question, then you're not welcome.  <br> <br> <br> <br>Mentor Application: (If I'm familiar with you and I think you would be a good candidate then I may allow you to bypass the application, although I would still like the name and quickfind code to whichever story you think best demonstrates your writing and maybe a little description about you to help with the pairings)  <br> <br> <br>User Name/Nickname:  <br> <br>How long have you been on the forums?:  <br> <br>Are you active?:  <br> <br>Do you have any stories on these forums so we could assess your talent as an author? If so, please provide a name and quickfind code. If accepted, your story(s) will also be listed by your name so a padawan can check out your writing before being paired with you:  <br> <br>Do you promise to be respectful towards your padawan and all those on this thread?:  <br> <br>Do you promise to help your adoptee and aid in their writing to the best of your ability?:  <br> <br>Is there anything else you would like to tell us about yourself, like your preferred genre of writing or about your personality?:

Supreme and total overlord of this thread.  <br> <br>Assistant leaders: Englishkid62  <br> <br>Assistant leaders help run the thread and can accept and process applications, like when deciding whether or not someone meets the qualifications to be a mentor, as well as help settle any disputes that may arise and just answer any questions someone may have.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>List of Mentors:  <br> <br>1. Elitemage14. Current padawans: Green Pie11, Reke, and Cookieking5 <br> <br>A bit about the mentor: I'm a pretty quiet guy, but I'm friendly and can be more outgoing at times. I mainly write action-adventure stories but with some aspects of other genres sprinkled in. I've also been told my strengths are my plots and characters, which I have to agree with. But if you're looking for an emotional writer that can spend pages describing the most miniscule of details, then I'm probably not your guy.  <br> <br>Examples of my work: Straightjacket 49-50-158-60534373 and Koshei the Deathless 49-50-741-60535019 <br> <br> <br> <br>2. ZedzDedHon. Current padawans: Yoh the Noob  <br> <br>A bit about the mentor: &quot;Generally, I'm fun-loving, and willing to help when needed. I tend to gravitate towards the darker side of adventure, or just adventure as a whole. Occasionally I venture into horror and dark humor, but those areas are a bit of a work in progress, haha. <br> <br>I'm fairly active throughout the week, and I'm dedicated to my stories, at least as of late. I make honest attempts to write every day, and I feel that I'm pretty good at it. Straight away work truly isn't my thing, though. Humor always needs to be present, or things get stale and I stop working.&quot; <br> <br>Example of his work: Sanguinesti: Extinction  49-50-88-60587258 <br> <br> <br> <br>3. Leela Feliz. Current padawans: Rao Bear and vulcangod00  <br> <br>A bit about the mentor. &quot;I am almost always happy or looking at the bright side, I prefer to write about happy things and romance is my genre.&quot;  <br> <br>Example of her work: The Origins of The Doormat 49-50-839-59610925

4. Englishkid62, aka English. Current padawans:  i pwn damen and KH E A R T S (He's unlikely to take another padawan) <br> <br> <br>A bit about the mentor: &quot;As you probably know from my stories, I am not a fan of adventure, action, or scripted stories. I am not interested in blood, gore, or sword fighting. I'm interested in out-of-the-box stories, writing that has a unique quality, or oddity, about them. How to describe myself? Strange, perhaps. A weirdo, but a cool one. I can be a very good friend and I enjoy a decent conversation. I can be pretty deep if I wanted to <img class="sm2" alt=":P" title=":P" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" />. But get to know me and form your own opinion would be best. I believe I know quite a lot about writing because I studied English Literature, and other creative writing guides. So if you do wish to excel in your own unique genre, don't be afraid to get in touch. I won't bite, I hope.&quot; <br> <br>Example of his work: The Priceless, QFC: 49-50-890-60645640  <br> <br> <br> <br>5. Poller5 aka Poller. Current Padawans: Uber141 <br> <br> <br>A bit about the mentor: My preferred genre of writing is definitely fantasy and A/A, though I have quite the taste for the epic as well, with a lot of inspiration from Tolkien and old mythology. I was hugely active around these parts three years ago, and am still actively involved in the community, which has suffered of late, and is something that I'd love to see restored, hence my involvement here. <br> <br>Examples of his work: Fimbulvetr, a short story: 49-50-44-58066256, and Illuminating Shadows, full-length, but unfinished: 49-50-789-56036848. <br> <br> <br> <br>6. Sirapyro. Current padawans: iTz BeAsTn <br> <br> <br>A bit about the mentor: &quot;I personally prefer the &quot;A/A&quot; Genre, but I will read just about anything. Personality wise, I am a bit quiet. I don't think very highly of myself, but that does not affect my ability to(at least attempt) help people.&quot; <br> <br>Example of his work: Life of Crime � 49-50-772-60004794.

7. Areno. Current padawans: Amoratan and Ing <br> <br>Some people say I'm cruel, some people say I'm rude, but that all depends on who you are. If you aren't cocky and close-minded, then we'll work out just fine. I love fantasy adventure, but I will venture forth into the areas of horror, dirty humor, sci-fi, and poetry. I usually write in the manner of medieval, but I will sometimes go futuristic (never really go modern). I love classical music, for I think it helps me write better. I take great admiration in people who take the time to learn, so I will enjoy this program and a padawan that wishes to do that very thing. That's me I guess, if you want to get personal... please go away. <img class="sm2" alt=":P" title=":P" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> <br> <br>Examples of his work: 49-50-100-60624274  <br> <br> <br> <br>8. iC*uk. Current padawans: Logan Shafts and  Arkkataka  <br> <br>A bit about the mentor: &quot;I prefer fantasy (considered A/A in these forums, given the game's setting), with some delving into sci-fi; I can be a bit harsh on the criticism sometimes, though I try to ensure it's always constructive. In addition, I think all writers need to have a solid understanding of grammar before they proceed with much else. I also fail to proof-read my own stuff; you'll find lots of typos. XD  <br> <br>Also, you padawans'll have to come talk to me; I likely won't go looking for people due to other commitments; I have enough stories I'm supposed to read already. However, if I accept you, those previous commitments won't get in the way of my help being available to you&quot; <br> <br>Examples of his work: Echoes of the Gods; Misty Depths

9. Xen Wolfe. Current Padawans: The Cicopath <br> <br> <br>A bit about him: &quot;My preferred genres are Action/Adventure and Sci-fi, though on these forums I tend to stick mostly to A/A Fantasy. I've branched out into Realism/Thriller a couple times in the past, and I've dabbled in genres like Romance and Horror as well. Most of my experience, however, is in A/A Fantasy--it's what I started with, and I keep on coming back.  <br> <br>I'm generally very down to earth on the forums, and I may not always have a sense of humor when I'm mentoring--and I may not have a lot of patience if you start @#$%ing around. But I have (if I may say so) a good eye for detail, and if asked to look over a story I will do so line by line. My schedule tends to vary, so I may not always be on, but when I am and when I am called for I will give my complete attention to the task at hand. However, YOU have to ask for ME--unless you come for help, I'll be engaged running Nexus Academy or updating my story.  <br> <br>If you've got a messenger system outside of RuneScape, it would be extremely beneficial to use it. Even if I'm not always on the forums, I'll almost always have my various accounts active.  <br> <br>Also: I will only accept one learner.&quot; <br> <br>Example of his work: 'Prodigy' - 49-50-154-60779406 <br> <br> <br> <br>10. Reegena. Current Padawans: Obeudan  <br> <br> <br>A bit about her: &quot;I enjoy writing, and I love helping other people. I had a review thread a couple of times and a few popular stories. I write mostly action adventure, but I love sprinkling romance and other side plots into my stories. I won't be able to help anyone write a scripted story, though. Sorry <img class="sm3" alt=":(" title=":(" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" />.&quot; <br> <br>Example of her work: Infamous 49-50-387-60195456

I can be fun but I can also be serious. I usually write horror, adventure, or war stories.&quot; <br> <br> <br>3. Wintry Elf/Elfie  <br> <br>A bit about him: &quot;I can be outgoing when I want to be, and serious when I don't. I prefer to write A/A but I'm touching on the more romantic side of things. I'm into gore and horror as well, I like to write about terrifying things. Just don't ask me to write modern. <img class="sm2" alt=":P" title=":P" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> I would prefer to be paired up with one of the more advanced/renowned/appreciated writers here on the SF for the sake of gaining more knowledge - I know my rudiments.&quot; <br> <br>Example of his writing: Snowy Short Stories 49-50-884-60727382 <br> <br> <br> <br>4.

6. Kuanoni aka Noah  <br> <br>His goals: &quot;My goal is mainly to master the difficult art of detail. I get great main plot ideas but i can't seem to force them on to my paper. I'm looking for a mentor who doesn't pound me into the ground for making a mistake.&quot;  <br> <br>A bit about him: I almost always come up with ideas based around the fantasy medieval type action adventures. I also am pretty outgoing but i know when it's serious time. <br> <br> <br>7. Axle Leroy <br> <br>His goals: &quot;I'm aiming to learn how to flesh out my ideas a little more, because my stories are always about 30 seconds long and then I get writer's block.&quot; <br> <br>A little about him: &quot;Well, I already feel (I know I sound cocky) like I have a firm grasp on spelling, grammar etc., and my preferred genre is on the darker side of Fantasy and A/A. I do tend to be a difficult person, so I wouldn't advise anyone with too little patience to adopt me. My personality changes a lot, but usually I'm really hyperactive and happy.&quot; <br> <br> <br> <br>8. Sgtpepper431 <br> <br>His goals and what he's looking for: I want a mentor that can help me get rid of writer's block, and to help me expand my style of writing. I want to be able to fascinate people with amazing, fanciful stories.  <br> <br>A bit about him: I like to write Jules Verne-style Sci-Fi and A/A mostly. I also delve into horror and poetry every now and then. I'm kinda in between shy and outgoing. I'm a science and history nerd (lol). Oh yeah, I have an A in Advanced English. I don't need lessons on that. <img class="sm6" alt=":D" title=":D" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> <br> <br> <br> <br>9. ITIalevolent aka Malevolent  <br> <br>His goals and what he's looking for: I don't think I often make mistakes nowadays, but I really need someone who can help me improve. I'm stuck in my writing and I don't know where to take it.  <br> <br>A bit about him: Hm, preferred genre... I'm really not sure, I write a lot of different styles. Personality, I guess I'm semi-outgoing.  <br> <br>Example of his work: 49-50-443-61056246.
