You may ask.  <br>The Kingdom of Varrock is a Player Owned City.  <br> <br>&quot;Unlike many other clans, K.O.V is a POC (Player Owned City). This is a role-playing group that centers around a city and behaves like an actual Kingdom, with a royal family, knights and all. And again, unlike many clans, we are not completely combat based. We have positions available for both army and noncombat members. The Kingdom of Varrock is indiscriminate. We accept all combat levels, skill levels, knowledge levels, and time zones, given you follow our rules and are active.&quot;-K0v Chat.  <br>|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|  <br>This POC does various things, from the large to the small. From making your own shop, to fighting in a war with your Brothers in Arms fighting beside you.  <br> <br>You have nothing to lose, but everything to gain. JOIN THE KINGDOM OF VARROCK TODAY!  <br> <br>&quot;The ground fought against me as I climbed the final steps of Varrock. With my men at my side and my forces in the field. I took the chamber filled with the holy elixir and looked over the room. Chambers filled with gold, diamonds the size of cannonballs, gems and silver goblets filled to the brim with life, happiness, and love. &quot;I shall not take what is worth nothing to me, I shall only take the cherished hearts of the loved to the halls of life, and pray god Accepts them.&quot;- Private Ferrariic, with his words to the heavens.
