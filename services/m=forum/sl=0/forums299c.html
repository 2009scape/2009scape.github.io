<div class="msgcontents">

I started playing Runescape a little under four years ago, after seeing a friend playing while staying at my house. He gave me a brief explanation, and soon after 'matt le chef' was born. <br> <br> Upon waking for the first time in Gielinor, I was a little daunted. Not wanting to risk the big bad world outside the castle I ventured in (after twice walking round it looking for something interesting). The first person I stumbled across was none other than the cooks assistant, how fitting <img class="sm0" alt=":)" title=":)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> after a brief chat I had somehow started a  quest?? Not really understanding what this meant I continued on my adventure. Some woodcutting, fletching, fishing, cooking and inevitably, cow killing ensued. Along the way I had stumbled across an egg. My quest was coming along nicely (I still needed flour though?) without any real effort on my part <img class="sm6" alt=":D" title=":D" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" />  <br> A few days later and after asking my friend some advice on the quest, amongst other things, I was no more the wiser! (turns out his game playing consisted of kill kill kill str str str kill kill kill). I decided to venture north to Varrock <img class="sm8" alt=":O" title=":O" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> in search of some more sound knowledge (I had been told it was the place to be) after only a few minutes in Varrock, some kind fellow (I forget the name) pointed me towards the knowledge base. After hours of reading and back and forward researching I finally decided I was ready. <br>  <br> I entered the game and returned to Lumbridge. I figured I'd return to the start point of my quest. After some looking about and some very repetitive conversations with the cooks assistant, a mighty lvl 126 (this was pre summoning) called 'mr 2wives' enquired as to whether I was in need of assistance? I explained my conundrum and much to my amazement he simply called 'follow me!'. I duly obliged. Down to the basement we went and over the random chest sat in the corner?? He turned after a few minutes and a little red message appeared in my chat box.He told me to click it and up popped the trade screen

quickly followed by one of those illusive pots of flour lol! A few short clicks later and it was mine! I was so excited I ran for the ladder without even a �ty�. I quickly returned but my savior had gone? And again people seemed fascinated with that random chest? <br> Returning to the kitchen, and engaging in a much more interesting conversation than those previously, I was quickly rewarded with the quest complete screen informing me of my reward! And thus my love of quests had begun!  <br> Eager for more I promptly clicked on the cooks assistant, maybe he had more quests for me to boldly go on? And of course he did <img class="sm0" alt=":)" title=":)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" />  <br> Having accepted his offer of a fresh quest I quickly scrolled through my quest list and stumbled across a new yellow quest 'recipe for disaster'! Having learned from previous mistakes I logged out and searched the forums and knowledge base.... <br> <br>And there it was, the quest of all quests! My goal was set! As mighty as it seemed I was determined. Determined to get the lvls, determined to complete the quests needed, determined to gain access to those items in that random chest lol! (for a comprehensive list of lvl requirements try the sticky on the front page of this forum or go to  20-21-432-60723163) <br>  <br> <br>Over the next couple of months I worked tirelessly towards my goal. The lvls and quests past thick and fast and I was well on my way. Then came a day that I'll never forget. I had just entered Seers village bank when in the middle of the room stood a girl, a girl in a white and blue cape, with a familiar looking symbol on the back. 'That must be one of those new skill capes!' I thought, 'but which one?'. Just as I was typing the inevitable question, out of nowhere, the girl was surrounded by lightning and slowly lifted into the air, before landing triumphantly back where she had been standing. I was hooked! I wanted some of that!! Discovering it was the quest point cape changed  everything. The goal posts had shifted! I wanted that cape!

<div class="msgcontents">

I quickly set about checking lvls needed for all the quests, which quests gave experience in skills I needed to raise and which ones would get me closer to the points needed to start others. I comprised a list and set about my adventure once more. <br> <br> I was soon rattling through quests and was soon wearing my legends cape, and up to the final battles of recipe for disaster. I can't remember my combat lvl but it was in the 70's. I died! Mostly due to really bad lag (that's my story, and I'm sticking to it lol!). I decided then that I would save these final battles as a sort of ceremony for getting my cape. Knowing I needed at least an 85 combat lvl (for dream mentor) I decided I would aim to get my cape at that lvl. I worked tirelessly over many weeks and finally the end was in sight. <br> <br>I had prepared for this day for what seemed like an eternity. The final battles in my quest of all quests were all that stood between me and that shiny new cape! As I stood next to the cooks assistant I couldn't help but feel a little nostalgic. I was ready! <br>  <br> I entered the banquet room and through the portal. The battle was long, the battle was challenging, but overall the battle was won! After one final conversation with my now close friend in the other room, I was off to get my cape <img class="sm6" alt=":D" title=":D" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> The wise old man didn't put up much of a fight and I was soon off back to Lumbridge for a ceremonial emote  extravaganza in the castle grounds, I stayed for about 15 minutes showing off <img class="sm2" alt=":P" title=":P" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> and then logged off for some well earned rest and sustenance. <br> <br> On my return I was a little lost as to what to do next. A few days of aimless wandering commenced. Finishing off a few lvls I was close to along the way. I was busy killing flesh crawlers when a game update warning appeared. To my surprise a new quest was released and matt le chef once again had an adventure to go on.

Logging back in I received a message saying I no longer had the requirements to wear my beloved cape!! The quest had to be done, and done now! Off I went and two short hours later I was once again proudly sporting my cape. Back to flesh crawlers I went. <br> <br> It was sometime later in that trip that the thought hit me! 'what if they released a quest I couldn't do?'. A new battle was ahead. A battle with the mightiest of foes. A battle to stay one step ahead of those developers at Jagex! Never would I be without my cape...never! My goal was set...lvl everything! How high though? Who knew what was to come...the dastardly jagex, that's who! The quests came and went but then the inevitable happened. Rocking out was released and I was 2 smithing lvls short <img class="sm3" alt=":(" title=":(" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" />! That meant me mining! And I hate mining! Some power mining ensued and I was soon super heating my way to the cape again. I continued my battle for many months. As time went by and my total lvl grew along with my combat lvl (it couldn't stay 85 forever) what was once respect and congratulations for having a quest point cape, soon turned into distain, and calls of 'get a real cape!' and 'nice noob cape!'. What had happened along the way? Why was not having a 99 skill such a big deal? I just didn't understand. As time has past I had grown to live with the quest capes place in peoples minds and have simply taken to seeking refuge in the quest forum. Reading peoples stories of both woe and joy during their journey to the cape. <br> <br>With the release of 'while guthix sleeps' our first 'grandmaster' quest and then the great run of high quality quests released over the later half of last year, the quest cape finally looked like it was coming into it's own again. The total xp required across all skills was now more than that of a single skill cape (for a comprehensive  guide to skill xp needed take a look at The Draziw's thread on 20-21-307-60421175)

Some of the battles had started to set apart those willing to train and work hard for their goal and those that had thought it to be an 'easy cape' I thought how can they improve on this recent run? <br> <br>So comes 2010 and along with it our 2nd 'grandmaster quest'. The quest forum went crazy! People were stuck! People were dying! And not just the noobs <img class="sm1" alt=";)" title=";)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> but those so called 'high lvl' players, even some of those mighty lvl 138's. After a day or 2 of practice runs with just food (no point practicing with full loads of brews etc) to learn the attacks and how to deal with them, I finally beat Nomad and reclaimed my beloved quest point cape <img class="sm6" alt=":D" title=":D" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> <br> <br> <br>So to my long awaited, and very drawn out point! Thank you Jagex! My toughest foe to date! The quest point cape is  finally receiving the respect it deserves. I once again feel like it means something, and will wear it proudly! Now I know that there are people out there not happy with the recent increase in lvl and combat requirements it takes to get the cape. 'How am I supposed to get that? What's the point?' well that's exactly what it was like when I was  staring at the rfd quest log. Albeit the posts have moved so significantly since then that I can see how daunting it must be to set out on the quest for the cape. But trust me when I say that the sense of accomplishment you will get in the end is well worth the time and effort! Don't stop believing, even if the goal gets pushed just that little bit further out of reach once more. <br>So with baited breath I await the next quest release and thus the next leg of my adventure. In the mean time I'll continue my battle with the developers. Maybe I'll finally finish off that one skill I have under 75...mining! (I hate mining!! Lol) just in case! And on towards 2000 total lvl, and from there? Who knows.

'Matt Le Chef news/goals/progress' + Contiuning the adventure <img class="sm0" alt=":)" title=":)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> <br> <br>With the release of the dungoneering skill, soon came my 2000 total lvl <img class="sm0" alt=":)" title=":)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" />I have currenly returned from my dungoneering expadition until either my internet stops lagging me out or they release a fix to the solo/non returning problem. Tears of guthix will have to keep my lvl ticking over for now. So I'm back to skilling, and rying to finish all lvls to 80 (looks at mining lvl and frowns!)  <br> <br>Edit: Buyers and Cellers, quite and enjoyable quest with some half decent rewards for the average thief. I liked the quest, especially the extra tasks. The guild is quite good although I'm probabl going to stick to making squirk juices for my thieving xp, for now at least. 7/10. <br> <br>Fairytale part 3, I was very impressed with the graphic updates although the quest didn't really meet up to all the hype. I liked it, and the rewards have proved to be very usfull, I just felt that it was a little short, and the lack of exploration/travel was a little disapointing. The boss battle was something different but after Nomad, not much of a challenge at my lvl. 7/10 again I'd say. <br> <br>Elemental Workshop 3, I liked this quest. Even though I just stated i like to travel and explore and this quest had none of that! The puzzle was deffinatly challenging, and for me that more than made up for the lack of adventuring. The rewards, although I'm sure have uses for some players, have not really been of much benefit to me. Although they do look kind of cool. <br> <br>I've just reached 50 posts <img class="sm0" alt=":)" title=":)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> Thanks to my lovely FairyGodess. Big love to you baby xxx <br> <br>Thanks to Poised Egg I've just reached 100 posts <img class="sm0" alt=":)" title=":)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> <br> <br>Thanks to Alafrank99 for making my 150th post <img class="sm0" alt=":)" title=":)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> <br> <br>Special thanks go out to Phoenix 4424 for keeping this thread bumped when ever I haven't been able to. It's very much appreciated!! Your a star!!
