~ Welcome to Skyness 80+ <img class="sm6" alt=":D" title=":D" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> ~ <br> <br>Skyness is a clan that is made by 01 May,Miauwtje2 and Het Schaap. <br>We used to be high-ranked players in a clan named thunderwolves, but because of some problems we deciced to make an own clan and have already made quite some success. <br> <br>This clan is for meeting new people, helping others and ofcourse to have fun. <br>We do about 4 events per week. The events vary from castle wars to group fishing, and more. We are a clan that thinks that everyone's opinion counts. This means that the events and ranks are not only chosen by the owner, but also decided by the members of the clan. You can vote at the 'Poll' section. <br> <br>Current member count: 32 <br>Home world: World 115. <br>Clan Chat: iLy Tine <br>QFC: 87-88-659-61164350 <br>Language: English. You are allowed to speak your own language unless there are people  <br>in the chat who do not understand you. We ask you what language(s) you speak in the application section.  <br> <br>We hope you have a great time in Skyness! <br> <br> <br>One more thing: We are P2P, please do not post applications if you are F2P.

You're new to the clan and are learning new things, following multiple <br>methods for rank up will help you.  <br> <br>2 Banana's: Falcon. You know how the clan works and probably know most of the other <br>members of the clan. Keep going on and you'll eventually get a higher rank. <br> <br>3 Banana's: Forest Eagle. You know everything of the clan and you should know the history, <br>too. You are now in hands of the members. They can vote for you to get a better rank. <br> <br>Bronze Star: Black hawk. You were voted by clan members for this, so prove yourself.  <br>You are doing very well and you gain access to special meetings. You are able to accept Applications. <br> <br>Silver Star: Admin. Once again you were voted to get a rank up. You can kick so do not abuse this! You can still do the same as the black hawk. You can organize events,too. <br> <br>Golden Star: Co-Owner. It's not likely you will reach this rank easily. Members cannot vote on you anymore, co-owners are chosen by iLy Tine. You can still do the same as an Admin and you can also accept guides. You may organize special meetings and make a poll.
