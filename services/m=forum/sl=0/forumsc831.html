A cruel slave driver whipped the large shirtless man who was toiling over a pile of rocks, shaping them into squares for the fortress walls, it was downed in the south the other night by the kings trebuchet*. <br> <br> &quot;Work faster and harder, and maybe we will 'ive you bread that ain't stale.&quot; The driver said, he and a soilder who was walking by laughed loudly.  <br> <br> &quot;We all know 'ow that un will go ovah with the boss.&quot; The soilder said as he passed by, nodding to another slave, one who was sitting down against the rock, looking to the sky with fatigue in his eyes. His pick layed beside him, the sun rays reflecting off the dented metal. The slave driver was about to go and whip the man back into work, as not only are the slaves punished (often fatally) but the driver in charge of that slave is too. <br> <br> All fell silent when the driver raised his whip. All the slaves around turned to watch. It was a brutal sight, the man tried to scramble to his feet and get busy before the heavy leather whip, weighing about 20 pounds and being 5 feet in length, came crashing down on his back. He got halfway up before his whole body was shot back to the ground from the force of the blow. A crack was heard as the mans nose broke. He didn't even try to stop his fall. It was pointless. As soon as the soilder who passed by on his routine check-up of the slave compounds reported the slave to the Lord of the fortress, he would be doomed.  <br> <br>If it wasn't for the spy. If it wasn't for him, this man would have thougt he was going to die. But he knew. Not long, the signal, a large plume of smoke, would be raised. It was a matter of wait and watch. The picks suddenly started striking rock again, and the driver whip ceased to raise and was still beside the man as the driver watched to the west.  <br> <br>A armour clad figure appeared, a large longsword hanging at it's side, in the gem crusted sheath of black leather. The armour was a dim silver, almost black, but more grey, and had a coppery gold trim. It wasn't

overly elaborate to the point that it would be redicilous to think of a man in midnight black armour with a gold trim. It was simple, but strong and impressive. In the mans hand was cruel looking axe, about 4 feet in blade length and with a 6 inch handle. The blade was both sharp and ridged, with triangles cut out of the blade all the way from the top down. The end of the blade curved inward toward the hilt and ended in a large spike, like the end of a sword. It was a cream colour, and was known as the &quot;White Reaver&quot; throught the slave compounds. People have seen all to well what it does. The name of the man who wielded the axe and wore the armour was Gorlund.  <br>  <br> He is the lord of the fortress and has been so for many years. He is a cruel man, but despite that his troops morales are surprising. The only ones under his control that are dissapointed with him is his many slaves. He had lived near the mountain range of Aryan in his fortress for so long without the king even so much giving a thought to him. But his forces have grown so strong, and his range of slave capturing has grown so far that the king had to respond before he was overthrown and this tyrant took control. <br> <br> Gorlund moved over to the slave driver holding the whip. He looked at him through his helmets visor with a cold look. He moved his fingers around on the axe grip wildy. Then, with a sudden yell, pulled the axe through the air and into the slave drivers skull. The force of the blow crushed the mans head under his rough iron helmet. He fell to the ground, no hope of even being alive, crumpling like a rag doll. Gorlund watched his body fall then turned to the slave. He raised his axe and prepared to strike, when he saw a large cloud of smoke suddenly appear in the other compound. He heard yells, rebellious yells, and next thing he knew was that his soilders were flooding in, spears,daggers,short swords, long swords and maces flashing as they tried to fight back the slaves and their cruely blunt picks

that were often crushing the soiders ribcages through their chainmail. Gorlund took a few steps back, one of his generals running into him. Gorland turned around and nearly killed the man with his axe when he saw it was his general. &quot;Come with me..&quot; Gorland told his General, making his way through the crowds. When they got to the gate at the west end, the one facing the mountains, Gorland commanded his general to open the gate. As he did so, Gorland hid along the wall beside the gate. When the general opened the gate he thought nothing of his lord, but for himself. He ran out the gate, heading for the pass that went up into the mountains and around back down to a forest then from the forest to the nearest city. He didn't make it that far.  <br> <br>Darren, the slave who was to be executed stood, bringing his pickaxe with him in a uppercut on the nearest soilder. The pickaxe smashed the mans jaw and he fell to the ground dead. Darren moved on to his next target, feral rage in his eyes. He stopped halfway when he heard a death yell from the gate. He turned to look and saw the kings soilders rushing in, their armour and crests flashing in the sun. Darren also saw Gorland escape through the gate after the last soilder entered the fortress.  <br>~~ <br>With the slaves brutality and the kings mens speed and perfection the battle didn't last long after. All of Gorlands men were dead, he was the only one to escape. He had ruled that fortress for many years. His men had not complained, they had surprisingly high morale. The king hadn't bothered to attack Gorlond because it had not infringed on the kings land. But when Gorlond starting pillaging villages for slaves and supplies in the kings' lands, and his forces grew strong, the king decided to react. And this was it, a powerful and sudden attack that was so devestating it took no more than one attempt. <br> <br>When Darren had saw Gorland escape he made a vow to kill him, sometime later in life, whenever he got the information or whenever Gorlond

showed his cowardly face. Darren hadn't done much after he was freed, he went with the kings men to the next city and stayed there, going to the Grand Chapel of Mathian weekly to pray to the newer god. The church of Mathian was formed not long ago, perhaps a hundred years ago. A saintly man had died, and many people believed him to have become a god. Thus, the church was formed. <br>~~ <br> It was several more years later that Darren caught upwind of Gorland from an acolyte of a unknown religion, the faceless god is what he said he worshipped. Gorlond was said to have been at one of the hidden churches, worshiping the god and looking for allies for something about destroying dawn and ending the light of the world, basically thrusting the world into a unending twilight. This event was the main plan and goal of the faceless god and his followers. It was supposed to bring the god to the world itself, he would walk it, and bring to his followers un-ending prosperity and a greater life, in which they shan't have to fear anything. <br> <br> There was a legend of this religion, one of the conditions for dawn to be broken, there had to be a appropiate bringer. Gorlond had fit the description perfectly and was thus, chosen by the acolytes. He now commanded a powerful army, both in physical and magical. And all it took was showing up to a hidden chapel. Darren heard this all from the acolyte who was...Drunk to the perfect point. Darren did what he had to with the acolyte aftwerwards of course, it was one of his enemies after all. <br> <br> Darren knew he needed an army of his own to assault and end Gorlond. But he needed people who were willing to march to almost certain death. The king would not lend aid, as the king had been acting odd lately. Darren would have to find peple interested in his goal, or who had nothing to lose. <br> <br> This was his challange, and the worlds challange was to survive Gorlond and his god, should he suceed. A burden layed on Darrens shoulder, a burden that layed on a grudge.

That be the intro. Readeth it or you -&gt;WILL&lt;- get lost. I refuse to give a brief summary, only a laydown of some rules. <br> <br>Unfortunantly, taking 8 people in to kill one man would be overkill. Thus, there are only 4 spots open for the Gorlond fight. 3 are reserved unfortunantly, so there is one open spot. I may choose to take 5 in, depending on how many people join the thread. <br> <br>The rest who are left out, won't be left out.

_____________ <br>List of Races| <br> <br> <br>Humans- Dur. <br> <br>Elves- A more advanced humanoid creature, they are slightly more intelligent than the human race, and are more fair and prefer the natural world than the industrialized world of humans. You know the drill, pointed ears,tall,woodland peoples and powerful magi. <br> <br>Dwarves- A gruff and rare race in the lands of Arian. They live mostly in the mountains of the west, and some odd groups can be found in the cold peaks of the Wild Mountain Range, which is closer to the south than the west. They are very sturdy and host a natural resistance to most magics and poisons, making them a very hardy race. <br> <br>Gualta: The Gualta are large hulky people with hunched backs and round, shapeless faces.The average Gualta has their sholders higher than the average man's head. Their large bodies and staggering strengh makes them popular with hard physical work, such as smithing, slavery and battle. Their natural strengh comes with a cost, however, very few Gualta can use magic, with only 42 magic uses within their recorded history, the Gualtas treat their magicians as prophets. The Gualta originate from large burrowed caves in the sides of the Wild mountain range.  <br> <br>Kahlin: Angel cat people. Not everyone in the race holds these traits. They can turn into felines but no matter what they have wings. They are seen as ill omens and are a very rare race. They survive off emotions, and blood. They can make their wings vanish if they must. Are rarely seen. They are able to foretell deaths. <br> <br>Reserve for player made race- <br> <br>Reserve for player made race-
