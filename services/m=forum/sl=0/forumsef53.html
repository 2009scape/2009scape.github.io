The two Magi walked through the darkened tunnels of the mines with a heavy pace, surveying the carnage and destruction with heavy hearts� thinking of the heavy repercussions of the previous night�s battle. Occasionally, they stopped to mourn for the loss of life at the hands of the cowardly attackers � the Vinamadoren � but there was much to be done in preparation for the looming continuation of the war so long put on halt. And so when they did linger, it was not long before they would move on. <br> <br>Blood and char scorched the rough-hewn tunnels under foot and up against the walls. Islands of bodies littered the ground beneath their feet, and the two walked with the terrible knowledge that unjustifiable numbers had fallen at their hands alone. Had either of them carried sword or spear, their weapons would have been stained the deepest red imaginable. But neither needed such crude tools to kill, and so they�d waded into the fray and watched as their enemies fell, cut down as wheat, before them. <br> <br>�Lachlan,� the first man said quietly, stopping to push a body onto it�s back so as to clearly see death�s face. �This one was one of yours, was he not?* <br> <br>The Melrakki looked long upon the youthful face of the fallen BattleMage, and his face tightened visibly. �Yes,� he said softly, sorrow washing through him. �Yurick al�Meera. Such a talented boy, and so well respected. He betrayed us� cast his lot in with the Vinamadoren.� <br> <br>�That knowledge would come as a great blow to the morale of both our Apprentices and confirmed Blackshirts.� They stared down at the empty body for a moment before the Mage continued. �He was cut down quickly? Good. Tell them he died a hero�s death. He died protecting Herfiligr and all those within.� <br> <br>�Oh, but it�s never that simple, Jerome,� the Melrakki answered, continuing on past the body. �War cannot be explained away. Death in these numbers cannot be explained away. Nor can such abject treachery. Our students are bright.

They will soon ask the questions we ourselves want answered How? Why? Above all, who?� <br> <br>Lord Arathorn�s face was firm, however, and he shook his head as he continued on with Master Fox. �Tomorrow we will begin burning the bodies and sending them off with their last rites. Yurick will receive full honors. But the Vinamadoren we bury. They do not deserve the honor of the flame. Gather all in the Great Hall. They must know who is culpable. They must know who will pay in full for our suffering this night.� <br> <br>-- <br> <br>The billy goat had escaped. Again. Lach stood several feet away, a length of rope in his hands, staring the stupid animal down. Moving slowly, so as not to rouse the goat to his actions, he shifted on his feet, and suddenly flung out the lassoed length, aiming to ring it around the goat�s miserable neck. With a derisive bleat, the animal danced to the side, locked eyes with Lach mockingly, and then lowered his head to graze. <br> <br>�Come on, Lach, get him!� Micah shouted in frustration. <br> <br>�Believe me, I�m trying,� Lach muttered under his breath, reeling in the rope and beginning to swing it again. <br> <br>�But you�re hopeless,� Micah moaned, tearing at his hair and sinking to the ground. �Come on, just freeze him! You�re a Mage!� <br> <br>The goat bleated again, one long, drawn out sound. �M-m-m-m-a-a-a-a-a-a-g-e,* it laughed. <br> <br>Biting back a grunt of frustration, Lach let fly the rope again, but it landed at least a foot in front of the goat again. With a roar of anger, Lach threw the end of the rope away from him and stomped away. �I am *not* a Mage!� he shouted to the crinkled black sky. �Did you hear me? I�M NOT A MAGE!� <br> <br>�You just keep believing that. It can�t change what you are,� a voice said from far away. �Now get up. It�s time to go.� <br> <br>Lach�s eyes snapped open and he sat up immediately, instinctively ducking his head against the ceiling of his den before realizing that he was no longer in the mines.

Blearily, he looked up, raising a hand against a bright light shining in his eyes. �Where?� he asked stupidly, his surroundings not quite registering yet. <br> <br>�The Myrr,� the Mage answered brusquely, bending and pulling Lach to his feet. <br> <br>Lach groaned as blackness overwhelmed his vision for a moment. He swayed on the spot, but the Mage�s tight grip on his arm kept him upright. Nauseous, he clamped a hand to his mouth, willing himself not to spew the meager contents of his stomach before being prodded into a fast walk by the impatient CouncilMage. ��But� Cira?� he asked, his voice distant, weak. �I need to say� goodbye.� <br> <br>�No time and no need.� They passed the rows of beds quickly, but people were already stirring, sitting up to watch the Fox as he was led off. �She�s demanded the right to come with you.� <br> <br>�You can�t-� <br> <br>In a flash, Lach was on the ground. His face stung, and there was a bright red weal where the Mage had backhanded him, but he did not dare raise a hand to nurse the ache. �Don�t tell me what I can and cannot do, Fox!� he growled, taking a step forward as if to strike Lach again. �Now get up. Arathorn�s forces may already be on the watch, and we must not be seen.* <br> <br>-- <br> <br>The small fleet of rowboats inched steadily through the choppy waves beneath a frighteningly stormy black sky. It was not a good omen. At the helm of the first boat, the CouncilMage stood, watching for the first sight of the Myrr. It was cold and miserable out on the open sea, and he was greatly looking forward to the comforts the Magi�s mountain home had to offer, which awaited him once he�d deposited his cargo. <br> <br>Mouth pressed into a thin line, he looked back to the very middle of the boat, where the Fox sat huddled, his shoulders hunched. Terror in his eyes, he appeared to be attempting to draw himself into the tightest ball he could, keeping himself as far from the surrounding water as he could. It hardly mattered, though, for they were all fairly drenched with the spray of the sea.

In all honesty, the CouncilMage could not see what was so intimidating about the young man. He was little more than a child, really, when one accounted for the length a Mage�s life could extend to. Then again� his eyes fell on the iron collar circling the Fox�s neck. ~What terrible power does it hold at bay?~ he wondered, swaying with the rhythm of the rocking boat. Long ago, the Council had outlawed the use of such devices; but Arathorn had placed it around the boy�s neck, and the High Mage had ordered it not removed. Not yet, at least. There was simply too much uncertainty when it came to the Fox. <br> <br>Looking farther back to the boat behind his, he could just make out the young Mage Cira. It had been� difficult... to separate the two for this journey, but quite necessary. Yes. Quite necessary indeed. Her devotion to the Fox was astounding and, quite frankly, worrying. Even without the use of magic, he�d worked his way into her mind and made a complete and devoted slave of her. Disgusted, the CouncilMage shook his head and turned back to face forward. He should not have allowed her to come along. She gave the Fox power he should be allowed within reach of. <br> <br>At long last, the boat hit the sandy sea bottom, and several oarsmen leapt into the frigid waters to pull the boat ashore. Walking low for balance, the Mage made his way to the center and lifted the Fox up by the armpit, prodding him to clamber over the edge of the boat and onto dry land. Standing a short distance off, a small party awaited their arrival, headed by Lorne, a young Mage with long black hair who currently headed the Myrr�s system of defenses. Curtly, the two nodded to each other, and the CouncilMage dragged Lachlan after him. <br> <br>�Good morning, Master Lorne. Have the other CouncilMagi arrived?� <br> <br>�Most,� the defense master responded, eyeing Lach with unhidden curiosity. �God, he looks just like the Melrakki.� <br> <br>�You fought in the war, sir?�

�No. But I am told Lachlan Fox Sr. once looked to be Falan�s twin, and this one looks to be Falan�s own son.� He tilted his head to the side as the rest of the fleet of rowboats came ashore and the Magi climbed from their vessels. �I was not informed that we would be� hosting� another guest.� <br> <br>The CouncilMage looked back, and his eyes locked on Cira, struggling to reach them against the fierce sea wind. �Not exactly�� he said with a small cough. �She is free to come and go as she pleases. Though caution, as always, is in order, I think.� <br> <br>�Naturally, naturally,� Lorne murmured, looking still more curiously at Lach as time went on. The boy looked quite uncomfortable under his gaze, shifting his weight from foot to foot and wrapping his arms tightly around himself, shoulders always hunched. �And to think� just two years ago, I denied the possibility of coming war. I blinded myself to reality because it was simply too terrible to contemplate.� <br> <br>�You weren�t the only one, sir.� <br> <br>�No. Well, come, then. We�ll bring him below the mountain. Afterward, Katya would like a word with you.� He gestured with two fingers to Lach, indicating that he should follow, but before Lach could respond, a sharp force tugged him into a stumbling walk.

*fingers broomstick* <br> <br>Rules: <br>A. I will not be accepting bios. <br>OWT. I hate reading bios. <br>3.14159. Non-bios must be AT LEAST 4k characters long. ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS! <br>Four. <br>V. No super powerful characters. <br>6. Rule 6 is so unnecessary. <br>SeVen. No ridiculously powerful characters. <br>Acht. You have not come to a thread where one-liners are acceptable. I want to see effort and proper grammar in every post! Please aim for a minimum of 1k characters per post. I will no longer forgive posts below this minimum. <br>9. What are you still reading this for?! Get writing! *glares* <br> <br>Hahaha, is that distracting� Oh well. <br> <br>X. Deal with it. <br>Oh yeah. No apologies. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>Magic <br> <br>Carefully reread rules V and SeVen if you want your character to be a Mage. And if not, reread them just for the heck of it. <br> <br>So. This is just a general overview of a Mage�s abilities, but I�ll leave a lot up in the air so that you all have the chance to shape magic as you will (within reason, that is). <br> <br>To begin with, a Mage�s power is determined not by age but by experience and dedication to master the wild magic. Magic, it its rawest form, is all around us. It is in the very air, and only certain gifted people have the ability to recognize magic for what it is, and to harness or tame it for their own uses. <br> <br>When a Mage reaches his mid to late teens, his abilities become manifest, though in is not uncommon for his talents to become clear at a later time. If not properly trained, a Mage is something like a magnet to wild magic, which will use the Mage as a conduit for its own uses. This can become very hazardous to those around the Mage, as well as the Mage himself. Due to this, young, aspiring Magi are required to appear before the Council so that a suitable master can be found to train the Mage and aid him in his quest to master control over his gift. A master will usually begin teaching an apprentice how to correctly reach for the flows of magic, harness, and either use or dissipate it.

It is this control that distinguishes a trained Mage from an untrained Mage, for an untrained Mage is controlled and used by his magic. <br> <br>Obviously, a Mage�s strength, self-discipline, and experience determine what tasks his magic can accomplish. A young Mage, for instance, might be able to light a campfire, but he could certainly not cause lightning to streak from the sky. A skilled MageSmith might be able to work magic into his wares, enhancing strength and durability of the object, but an inexperienced Mage could do no such thing. <br> <br>On to the longevity of a Mage. A Mage�s life is, in fact, lengthened through his work with and constant proximity to Magic. The stronger the Mage, the longer his lifespan. While some Magi will only live a few decades longer than the average human, it is rumored that some have lived an entire millennium!  <br> <br>Be creative! The sky is the limit, really, though I must impose two limits to magic for now. Firstly, no soothsayers please. Even I, an all-powerful Pirate Lord, cannot read the stars. And secondly, a Mage must never endeavor to create or un-create something. The results could be catastrophic. <img class="sm1" alt=";)" title=";)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> <br> <br> <br>Non-bios: <br> <br>As I�ve mentioned before, non-bios should be a solid two posts in length, though I�m certainly not restricting you to that length. You can really do anything you want with this, though I do want these hidden within the non-bio somewhere: <br> <br>--Approximate age (whether exact or a description of old vs. young, I don�t care) <br>--Any distinguishing features we might wanna know about? <br>--An example of personality (don�t tell me your character is extremely empathetic. Show it somehow) <br> <br> <br>It is up to you to work your character into the plot line. I won�t send my characters after you unless they have reason to go of their own accord. <br> <br>I love the butterfly effect. <img class="sm6" alt=":D" title=":D" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> The decisions you make now regarding your character�s personality will have a huge impact on the direction of this RP.

That said, make sure you have a set personality mapped out for your character even if you don�t reveal all in your intro. Take some time to carefully consider your character�s abilities and background before posting. <br> <br>If you want more than one character, one non-bio introducing the both of them (minimum of 4k characters) would be permissible. <br> <br>Any questions, just ask.

((All right, guys! The Summary is up! You can find it on the last three posts of page 42 and continuing on page 43, going through post 6. That's a lot of summary, guys. <br> <br>Also, one of the most important points from the first thread (and least remembered) is Lord Arathorn's stance on Mage/Common relations. And this is CRUCIAL! So, for your convenience, you can find his exact answer to Dusk on page 28, post 9 in End of the Interim. It might do some good if we all reread that.)) <br> <br>((Big, huge, MONSTER thanks to Eve!
