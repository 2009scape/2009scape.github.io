Hi there, welcome to the forum thread for Star Hunters also known as Hunt4stars, the first ever star team and the second biggest. On this thread you will find all the information you need to help you with star hunting and our team. <br> <br>If you wish to join our team then please read the first four pages of this thread, no signing up is required we just ask that you read our rules before you enter our clan chat for the first time to ensure you know how we work. <br> <br>You do not have to sign up with us or even ask if you can join our group as everyone is welcome but if you like you can register with us to become a proper clan member by filling out the template found below. However before you register make sure you carefully read the rules. <br> <br>Our team is active 24/7 so it doesn't matter where you are from as when you enter the clan chat someone will be there to help you hunt. <br> <br>Please remember be nice to the ranks in the clan chat, in particular the Generals and Captains, as they get nothing for helping to run the clan and when they tell you something it is for the good of everyone so please listen to them. <br> <br>The only clan chat that we use is Hunt4stars but before you join the clan chat make sure you have read the first four pages of this thread. <br> <br>Please bump this thread when you can but only when it is needed. <br> <br>Current Registered Members: 684 <br> <br>The winner of The Star of 2009 was Mr Itchy4.

Rule clarifications: <br> <br>Rules 1.3 &amp; 2.2 - Waves: <br>When the closest star is around 20 minutes away non star chat should begin to cut down and when the closest star is about 12 minutes away all non star chat must stop. <br> <br>Rule 1.3 - Other languages: <br>Outside of waves you may talk in other languages but keep to English when possible. Do not have long conversations in other languages that other people can not understand. Using bad language or offensive words in other languages is not acceptable. <br> <br>Rule 1.5 - Demanding: <br>This is demanding a star: <br>'Give me my star now' <br> <br>This isn't: <br>'Are there any stars I can help with please' <br> <br>Rule 1.6 - Spam: <br>This is spam as it takes up more than one line: <br>ssssssssssss <br>ssssssssssssss <br>sssssssssss <br>sssssssssssssssss <br> <br>As it only takes up one line this is not spam: <br>?????????????????????????????? <br>However this is still not needed so you should not do it. <br> <br>Rule 1.7 - Demanding kicks: <br>If you think that someone should be kicked that a rank has not noticed then you should send a pm to a rank which can kick telling them the problem rather than demanding a kick in the clan chat. Also if you have anything to contribute to an issue that a rank is dealing with then pm the rank rather than talking over the rank in the clan chat. <br> <br>Rule 2.2 - Star chat: <br>Star Chat is things like the scoper announcing time and requesting spotters, spotters volunteering for spots, accepting a spot, arriving at a spot and announcing the star as down and if a spot is clear or not. <br> <br>Star chat is not things like saying hello or goodbye, announcing level ups, apologising for breaking the star chat rule and talking about other activities near the spot (other spotters/clans, penguins, mining while waiting, forgot pick, etc). <br> <br>Rule 2.3 - Forbidden Worlds: <br>You may enter the clan chat on a forbidden world and you may solo a star on one while in the clan chat however you must not announce the star in the clan chat nor invite anyone from the clan chat to the star.

Rule clarifications: <br> <br>Rule 2.3 - PVP and Bounty Worlds: <br>Although you can't clan hunt and announce stars on PVP or Bounty worlds in the clan chat you can still be on a PVP or Bounty world while in the clan chat. PVP worlds are 26, 72 and 86 and Bounty Worlds are 18, 65, 124 and 137. <br> <br>Rule 2.5 - Finishing Mining: <br>If you are mining a star you can hop to help as a spotter on another hunt with the permission from the scoper of the star you were mining and you can leave the star if you don�t intend to mine another with the clan. You may hop to do a solo hunt after informing the scoper of the star you were mining. <br> <br>Rule 2.6 - Hopping: <br>This rule only covers one wave so you can't clan hunt a star one wave and hop to a clan hunted star the next wave if you have not helped in that wave. <br> <br>If you have 200 dust and others don't it would be polite to let them get their 200 dust first before you mine any more stars. It would also be polite to inform the scoper of the star that you intend to hop. <br> <br>Rules 2.6 &amp; 3.2 - Helping: <br>If you have either acted as a scoper or a spotter for a clan hunted star that wave than you are considered to have helped for that wave. Announcing a solo hunted star is not considered helping so you can not hop to another solo or a clan hunted star. <br> <br>Rule 2.7 - Accepting help: <br>If you are a scoper and you have enough spotters you should double or even triple people at a spot if there are no other clan hunts going on however if other clan hunts still need spotters you should direct volunteers to them. If the star is very close to landing scopers do not have to assign a volunteer to a spot if the scoper doesn�t believe they can reach the spot in time. <br> <br>Rule 2.8 - Non-members: <br>Non-members who wish to stay in the clan during star waves must talk to the highest rank in the clan chat at least 10 minutes prior to the start of the wave. We will only let them stay if they have a very good reason to stay in the clan chat.

How we hunt: <br> <br>All star clans work differently and in Star Hunters we work as a team. <br> <br>If you just want a star and don't want to waste time finding it then Star Hunters is not for you however if you want to hunt down the stars as a team and as well as making new friends along the way Star Hunters is one of the only star teams that offer this. <br> <br>The way we work in Star Hunters means that everyone works together to find the star and no one is left out. <br> <br>In Star Hunters there are three types of people Spotters, Scopers and Soloers. <br> <br>Spotters are people who stand at the star landing spots in an area and wait for the star to land while the Scoper keeps them updated. New hunters would probably be best to do this to start with until they learn the spots where stars land and become familiar with our rules also if you don't have over 44 Construction it would be easier for you to do this job. <br> <br>Scopers organise star hunts and tell the spotters where to go they are the people who use telescopes in POH's to find the stars. It is the scoper who you must ask if you want to spot and who keeps the spotters updated on the stars status. After you have hunted with us a few times and feel confident that you know our rules and the star landing spots you might like to try scoping but it's best you only do this if you have a telescope. <br> <br>Although our clan is about team work if you need a break from working as a group you might like to try being a Soloer. These people do both the scoping and the spotting as they are working on their own. Soloers can chose to open the star once they find it to wave helpers or they may decide to not open it at all. After you have scoped a few times and you would like a bigger challenge you might like to try Soloing a star. <br> <br>By working as a team Star Hunters avoids overcrowding at stars so you get the biggest rewards from stars but the biggest reward in Star Hunters is the team spirit and friendship that you will have trouble finding in other groups.

Complaints: <br> <br>In our clan we do our best to make sure everyone is fairly treated but sometimes mistakes can be made. If you believe someone has been allowed to get away with something they shouldn�t have, if you or someone else has been wrongly kicked or a leader is abusing their power then please let us know. <br> <br>If you have any problems at all with the clan and how it is run no matter what they are then please inform us so we can make the clan a better place for everyone. Use the template below to make a complaint about the clan or forum thread. <br> <br>Use this template if you have a complaint: <br> <br>Place of problem: (Either thread or clan) <br>Type of problem: (Unfair kick, Rule breakers not kicked, Rank abusing power etc) <br>Explanation: (What exactly happened) <br> <br>Remember you can not mention names on the forums so if you are making a complaint about a specific person you can not mention their name and must post like this: <br> <br>Place of problem: Clan <br>Type of problem: Rank abusing power/Unfair kicks <br>Explanation: One of the general ranks kicked multiple people from the clan chat without reason. <br> <br>If you make a complaint like this one the problem can still be tracked down and sorted without a name ever having to be mentioned. <br> <br>If you don�t want to make a complaint on the forum or you want to complain about a specific person you may send a pm to any of the Generals. If you don�t want anyone else to know about your complaint then it will be kept confidential. <br> <br>Remember a complaint is not a good excuse to have a rant about how the clan works as this doesn�t really help and can lead to flaming. Instead you should make a complaint like the example above and suggest how the problem could be solved. <br> <br>All complaints will be read and taken seriously.
