The procedures for No Confidence Votes are:  <br> <br>1. To impeach a Magistrate, a 60% clanwide vote in favor of impeachment is required. The same is required for a lower council member. It only takes one person's voice to call for an impeachment, but only under precarious grounds.  <br>2. Once impeachment is called, a voting will take place on the forums.  <br>3. If clan votes for removal, then proper vacancy procedures will be carried out. If clan votes against removal, the official will stay in his position.

-=-ACTIVITY-=-  <br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½  <br>Activity is vital to a clan. Without it the clan will be crippled, which will lead to inevitable demise unless things can be reversed. Our activity system which is by no means overly strict, but by no means overly easy.  <br> <br>The ideal Renaissance member:  <br>-Bumps thread often.  <br>-Attends as many events as possible.  <br>-Recruits players to The Renaissance.  <br>-Stays in the clan chat [Our Clan TR] as often as possible.  <br> <br>Just think B.A.R.S. To get promoted, you should perform those four tasks. Never ask for ranks; they can only be given to those who successfully perform these tasks as well as show respect and exceed expectations.  <br> <br>Activity sweeps are carried out once a month, usually before a meeting. If you do not meet these requirements within the month since you have joined the clan, you will be labeled as inactive.  <br> <br>Also if you are labeled inactive and booted, you will also be removed from clan, but will be free to re-apply.  <br> <br>If you are not going to be able to be active and you know that, then please use this form to notify us. If you do not, there will be no excuse if you end up being declared inactive or if you are removed from clan for inactivity.  <br> <br>Use the following form if you're afraid you are going to have to take a longterm break from the game for any reason:  <br> <br>___________________________________________________________________________  <br>-=-Taking a Break/Holiday/Inactive Form-=-  <br> <br>How long are you going to take a break from RuneScape?:  <br>What is the reason for this?:  <br>Roughly when do you estimate you will be back?:  <br> <br>Signed: [Your username]

Your membership in TR is a privilege, not a right. Those who break the rules will be punished.  <br> <br>BlackPoints (BPs) are given out to TR members who break the rules. In cases of lenient offenses, a warning will be given initially. If the act persists, the offender will receive a BP(s). Attaining a total of 10 BPs gets you booted from the clan. If you are booted from the clan, there is little chance of reconciliation. However, if you do wish for mercy, your choice to rejoin is usually determined by the magistrates.  <br> <br>----------Offense--------------------------Punishment  <br>-Arguing in CC/Thread---------------------2 BP  <br>-Spamming in CC/Thread----------------3 BP  <br>-Opposing Leaders' Orders--------------3 BP  <br>-Wrongfully Kicking Clan Members----3 BP  <br>-Opposing Wartime Orders--------------4 BP  <br>-Skipping a Mandatory Event--------------5 BP  <br>-Spying for Another Clan------------------10 BP  <br>-Multi-clanning-------------------------------10 BP  <br> <br>ï¿½BPs are to be given by leaders only.  <br>ï¿½If a leader is not on to witness an offense, it will be reported on the thread.  <br>ï¿½Depending on the severity of the offense, the amount of BPs given may be more or less than stated in the chart.  <br>ï¿½Accumulating 5 BPs leads to a demotion. Commoners may be demoted to a trial member upon receiving 5 BP's.  <br>ï¿½Those who have been demoted due to BP's are not eligible for any promotion until their record clears back to under 5 BP's.  <br> <br>If you have accumulated BPs, for each subsequent week that you show a clean offense, 1 BP will be taken off your record.
