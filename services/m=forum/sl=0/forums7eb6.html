We are an Australian based clan. Aussie Legends is a clan for people to come and make some friends and have a fun time whether it's at events or just hanging out. Aussie Legends has well experienced leaders that have lead clans before, the last time this clan was active was early 2008 where it was shutdown by the leader. But now its back ready to start off from scratch and hope new people will join.   <br> <br>We do a wide range of events to try and cater for everyone, from skilling events like fishing trawler and stealing creations to safe pvp events like castle wars or clan wars up to big boss fights like Bandos or KBD. We look at giving everyone leadership experience so you can run events at almost any rank, although there are restrictions, look at the ranks post for further details.  <br> <br> <br>Clan Chat: AussLegends  <br>Home World: 114(Total 1500+)  <br>:46 (Total 1500-)  <br> <br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½*ï¿½.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½*ï¿½.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½*ï¿½.ï¿½  <br>TABLE OF CONTENTS  <br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½*ï¿½.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½*ï¿½.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½*ï¿½.ï¿½  <br>1.1 Introduction  <br>1.2 Clan news  <br>1.3 Clan rules  <br>1.4 Event Schedule  <br>1.5 Clan application  <br>1.6 War status/Allies and Rivals  <br>1.7 Leadership Roles  <br>1.8 Clan Members (high ranks)  <br>1.9 Clan Members (130+,120+,110+)  <br>1.10 Clan Members (110-)  <br>2.1 Signatures  <br>2.2 Signatures (continued)  <br>2.3 Clan Awards  <br>2.4 Event Log Form  <br>2.5 Initiative Log Form  <br>2.6 RESERVED  <br>2.7 RESERVED  <br>2.8 RESERVED  <br>2.9 Up Coming Members  <br>2.10 Warnings and Bans
