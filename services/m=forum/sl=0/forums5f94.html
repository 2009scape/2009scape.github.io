Hello and welcome everyone, Mind (Ms Abbi) and I are excited to introduce to you The World Events Bureau (WEB)! OUR OFFICIAL CLAN CHAT NAME IS ï¿½WEB EVENTSï¿½. Feel free to join us even if we arenï¿½t in an event to chat and enjoy the benefits of the community. I am sure you are dying to know more about us, therefore I will introduce myself and Mind (Ms Abbi). <br> <br> <br> <br>I would like to introduce Mindï¿½ <br> <br>Hey, I'm Mind, or if you prefer, Abbi. I absolutely adore this community and believe that it is full of amazingly gifted eventers who know how to host an event and make it a good one! If you were talking about me, i love pirates and lemons, and have a tendency to shout out 'braainnss' at random moments in time, as anybody in the clan chat could tell you. I love making new friends and my private chat is always on <img class="sm0" alt=":)" title=":)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" /> <br>~Abbi <br> <br>Hello, I am Quirk X and I have been involved with the eventing community for quite a few months now. I always love to meet new people. I always try to have fun whether it is making a little joke or getting to know you better. I hope to see you join our group, even if it is just a little bit every here and there. I am looking forward to a successful group<img class="sm0" alt=":)" title=":)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" />. <br>~Quirk X <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>________________________NEWS________________________ <br> <br>If you have been in the clan chat recently and noticed that everyone is a smiley face, don't worry. We are working on the new ranking system. We will leave those people who have star ranks with their current rank. <br>The ranks will be given out at the meeting this Saturday (tomorrow). The system will base your rank on the following: participation in the events, meetings, and on the thread, your attitude, helpfulness, cooperation and communication with other members, and finally commitment. <br> <br>If you have any other questions please ask Abbi or myself. If we aren't on feel free to leave a post on the thread<img class="sm0" alt=":)" title=":)" src="../../../site/img/blk.gif" />.

There is no point in having events if we all arenï¿½t having fun with them. The events are a great way to spread all of the joy and kindness that we have. <br> <br>ï¿½Our Second objective that is just as important as the first one is to have a positive impact on everyone whom joins our group, whether it is to talk or to join in our events. If we can achieve this objective we will all be happy and will be able to work together and get along very easily. So remember there is no need to drag anyone down, because you will probably be cheered up pretty soon. <br> <br>ï¿½Our Third objective is to get everyone involved that wants to in order to make everyone feel accepted by the community. If you feel this isn't happening please leave us a message.
