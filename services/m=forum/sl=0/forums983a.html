Each time we introduce small improvements to the game (patches), we release a list of the changes in a thread called 'patch notes' in the Recent Updates forum. <br> <br>In addition, we have created this archive thread so that all the patch notes can be posted here, to act as a permanent record of the patches released. <br> <br>As this thread is intended to act as a source of information only, the thread will be locked.  <br> <br>However, if you wish to comment on the latest patches, you can post on the current thread, in the Recent Updates forum. <br> <br>If you want to let us know about a graphical error or possible bug in the game, please use the 'Submit a Bug Report' option from the top tab bar help menu, on the main page. <br> <br>We hope you find this archive interesting and useful! <br> <br>Steve
