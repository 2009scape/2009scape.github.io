\ï¿½/ï¿½`ï¿½,.,ï¿½ï¿½`ï¿½ï¿½Dragon Avengers Info v.1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½`ï¿½,.,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½\ï¿½/  <br> <br>Welcome to Dragon Avengers.  <br> <br> <br>We dont exactly want to be the biggest or best clan. We just want to have fun with what we do in the game and be able to make new friends and hang out. We know you all have real lifes also and aren't on Runescape all the time. So, if you miss stuff it is ok. We do however require that you attend events so if you fail to attend events you will be removed from clan. Also our Clan Chat is set to private so you will have to wait untill a leader can add you. Master and I have both been and lead in previous clans. We were both in Saradonim Dragosn and The New Revelation. We now lead together in Dragon Avengers.
