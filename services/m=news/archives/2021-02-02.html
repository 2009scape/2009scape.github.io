<p>Runescape's economy was always based on bots.</p>
<p>Since Runescape Classic, bots have been a part of the game (heck, they're even the
                                    reason Runescape Classic was played for so long!). With the recent addition of bot
                                    worlds over at OpenRSC (another great Runescape project), we've decided to take the
                                    same step forwards.</p>
<p>
                                    We've always had bots in the game populating the GE, keeping the game feeling alive,
                                    so much so that when we removed them players rioted in Falador. But instead of
                                    playing a cat and mouse game (with some of our own developers, even), we decided to
                                    unlock them for all; going forwards, <b>everyone can bot</b>.
                                  </p>
<p>
<i><b>But I worked so hard!!</b></i>
</p>
<p>
                                    Fear not! Players who bot, even once will be permanently removed from the default
                                      hiscores, and we're looking at other ways of tagging them too. Authentic accounts
                                      will forever be respected and honored, just as they were before. Think twice
                                      before enabling this on your main!
                                  </p>

<p>To start botting, type
                                  </p><pre>::scripts</pre> in-game to see a list of scripts. Have a script you'd like to
                                  see?
                                  Fork the project, write it up and submit a PR! Also, please note more scripts are
                                  planned to be added in the future, this is mostly just the groundwork.

<b><u>Other updates</u></b>
</p>
<p>
                                    Since we just had an update a few days ago, we've just got a few patch notes for ya
                                    :)
                                  </p>

                                  Core Changes:
                                  <ul>
<li>
                                      Server now has better start/stop functionality
                                      <ul>
<li>::update will actually completely end the server process now so updating
                                          will be
                                          easier and smoother than ever
                                        </li>
<li>There is also no longer a possibility for players
                                          to log in "too early" as the networking doesn't get started until the server
                                          is
                                          completely up and running!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The server now makes use of RSA encryption</li>
<li>Server has an all-new system for the grand exchange that attempts to address
                                      several major issues</li>
</ul>

<li>Stats now drain/restore properly once again</li>
<li>Super Energy potions now restore the correct amount of run energy</li>
<li>Brine Sabre now has the proper animations and a handled special attack</li>
