          As we start to grow our playerbase again slowly but surely we run into some new obstacles of what content 
        should we focus on. When it comes to contributors a lot of the source has spots that it's not very well documented
        while other spots it doesn't have some decent documentation. However, wouldn't it be nice to go through and document some 
        more just so if any new developers stop by they are able to just pull that right up and work from there? In the next couple of weeks 
        we shifting our focus towards a cleaning up the project a bit. The dev team will be auditing current code while 
        converting old java class files into kotlin. Our goal has always has been to convert to Kotlin. Adding more methods to the server API and 
        like I stated above in-deph commenting for classes and methods. This overall should speed up all future implementations as well
        as bring on more developers who are less familiar with the source. 

        <br/>
<br/>

          Also, if you are not a part of the gitlabs, stop what you are doing and go create an account. This will allow you to have a voice 
        within the 2009scape community. This voice is strictly for live server members only but we have an amazing new RFC(Request for comments)
        section where you can give your idea of something to add and the community can discuss it and see if it fits. Again, we are based of 2009 era and 
        not everything will be deemed acceptable for this era but small little QoL things like the new addition that came from the RFC the ring of starsprites.
        Updates will now be every two weeks instead of one to give the developers more time to test their code and not rush updates. It will still be on a monday
        anyways buckle up and enjoy the updates for these last two weeks.
