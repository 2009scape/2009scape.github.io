      We are now in the month of August and if you notice our website's banner has now changed like it does every 
    month but thought I would point this out. We can thank Michael Carrot for the banners. I am excited to say that 
    despite a quieter week we still have some fantastic updates. So lets check them out! Before we do, I would like to 
    give a shout out to one of the M-Gang members Moukanubi for beating the fight cave and getting the fire cape!

    <br/>
<br/>
          This week on Legacy, we are looking at a whole lot added to our slayer skill. Do not worry! it is still the slayer
        you know &amp; love the skill itself has not changed. 

        <br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Slayer Skill Cape Perk</u></b>
</p><p>

        "As a grizzled slayer, you know preparation is key to confronting Gielinor's worst. The crafts of the Slayer Helmet 
        has inspired you to hone your equipment and keep all of your tools close to you, within your cloak."

        <br/>
<br/>

          Players that have learned how to craft a 'Slayer Helmet' may choose to consume a 'Slayer Helmet' to 
        apply its utilities: 'Nose peg', 'Earmuffs', 'Facemask', 'Spiny Helmet', and 'Black mask' at half its slayer 
        task bonus damage while the skillcape is equipped.

        <br/>
<br/>
<b>Do note that this will be applied permanently to the cape until lost, bonuses do not stack with a 'Slayer Helmet'.</b>
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Slayer Improvements</u></b>
<p>   
          Reworked how slayer stores and manipulates data to use bitflags (Andrew Gower would be proud), and 
        reworked the slayer task tracker completely. 

        <br/>
<br/>

        We have also lowered the slayer rerolls to only 10 a day since they took a bit of the game out of Slayer. 

        <br/>

<br/>
<br/> 

          As you can see a way neater and better looking design than before and improvements on functionality! 
       </p>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>No longer in the weeds</u></b>
<p>
           
          Another amazing update this week was the improvements on farming. I know there have been some issues 
       but no worries they have all been <b>patched</b>. Fun fact if you were under level 15 farming and stood next 
       to a patch too long a NPC would come out and let you know that you did not need to stand next to the patch 
       in order for it to grow!

      
       </p><ul>
<li>Added exactly just that! The npc that comes out of nowhere and lets you know you can do other things while waiting for crops.</li>
<li>Refactored crop harvesting to use the authentic lives system</li>
<li>Herbs now should give perfectly authentic harvest amounts</li>
<li>Corrected how Herb disease and death is handled and set.</li>
<li>Implemented Spirit Weed</li>
<li>Allotments, Hops, Belladonna and Cacti should now give closer-to-authentic amounts.</li>
<li>Added a ContentAPI method for poof-clearing an NPC (think random event NPCs)</li>
<li>Supercompost now increases a crop's lives by 2, and regular compost by 1.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Dwarves, Cakes, and Randoms</u></b>
<p>
            This week we give you pvm folks something you have been waiting for and hope you choose to use! amd 

            </p><ul>
<li>Added temporary ground item spawn for Dwarven rock cake to the underground pass underneath White Wolf Mountain (Requires completion of Fishing Contest to access)</li>
<li>Added examines to both the hot and cold Dwarven rock cakes</li>
