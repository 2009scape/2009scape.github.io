  <p> 
    Since the Github Launcher links kept confusing people into wondering which launcher was the correct one to download we have decided 
    to remove the list. With this being said we do not want to destroy our history of information on updates were what so this will be a post 
    showing all the different launcher updates!

          <br>
          
  
          This client fixes right-click issues people were having.
          <br>
          <br>
          Keep in mind, that the same old clients will always connect to the continuously updating server! You don't need to update unless something goes wrong :)
          
  
  
      </p>
  
  
      <b><u>2009scape Release v1.02</u></b>
      <p><i>Bracket Released this on Jan 11, 2020</i>
          <br>
          <br>
          Same content as before, this time with a more stable provider. Enjoy!
      
      </p>
  
      <b><u>2009scape Release v1.01</u></b>
      <p>
          <i>Bracket released this on January 10, 2020</i>
          <br>
          <br>
          Updated IP to match new host.
          <br>
          <br>
          There's some bugs in tutorial island, relog if something bad happens to you.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hopefully some people enjoy!
          <br>
          <br>
          (Also, bug me on Discord if the client won't connect. I'll restart the server.  </p>
      
      
      <b><u>2009scape Release 1.0</u></b>
      <p>
          <i>Bracket released this on November 4, 2019</i>
          <br>
          <br>
          The live server is probably going to have another reset but here's a client to connecting it so people can test things out. Good luck and have fun!
          <br>
          <br>
          Note: These are huge downloads because they include the server code in them for now... Just uh, ignore that. </p>
