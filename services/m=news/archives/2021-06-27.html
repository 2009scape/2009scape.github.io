<!-- Post goes right in here -->
<p>

    Jumping back into the Timeline of 2009scape again with some new changes from the last time I had posted. The last real post was deciding if we were working towards 
    having a completely wiped or not wiped World 2. Well, the votes were very close but the community had decided to have no wipe whatsoever! Fantastic news for some. 
    With rares and other items floating around again the world will feel more full again. I would go on with my own words to explain our decisions but since not everyone is 
    on our discord channel and most wait for a website update I thought I would share the Announcement here. 
    <br/>
</p><blockquote>
        
        As for a general status update to the state of the project - here's how it is, plain and simple. 
        My life has gotten a lot busier recently. I no longer have the time to dedicate to working on 2.0 and getting it up and going as fast as I would have liked. It will still be worked on, but with much less focus than before. Instead, I'm going to shift more of my spare time back over to maintaining and improving the legacy codebase as that has a more immediate positive effect on our community. 
        
        <br/>
<br/>
        
        As for World 1, we would recommend not playing on it at all in the days moving forward and it will likely be removed from the launcher/replaced with world 2 for the time being. When world 1 re-emerges, it will be in the form of 2.009 with full authentic content. 
        
        <br/>
<br/>

        As for World 2, we have decided that we are going to take a new and unique approach to it. World 2 will continue running the legacy codebase even after the 2.0 launch, that way new improvements and bugfixes to the legacy codebase will not go to waste. 
        
        <br/>
<br/>

        In summary, 2.0 is going to take longer than expected. World 1 should now be considered disabled until further notice, but when it relaunches it WILL be running 2.0. World 2 will continue running the legacy codebase for the entire forseeable future.
        <br/>
<br/>
        Thank you all, I appreciate you all.

    With this being said we have done just that. The entirity of World 2 is now Open source and worked on again by our development team. Make sure you check out our <a href="../../../site/community/contributors.html">Community Page</a> 
    in order to see what you need to do in order to get the role of contributor.
