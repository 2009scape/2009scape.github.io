                                     Hello everyone! It's just me, Summer back with another edition of News post. This isn't our typical News post where we discuss the current 
                                     updates going on within the game. It is your community post discussing changes and upcoming stuff within the community.

                                     <h3>Easter Event</h3>
                                     <p>   Of course, I am going to start this post with talk about our Easter event that started on April 15th. This will be our second Easter event in 
                                         2009scape. April of 2020, was basically the true beginning of this server and April of 2021 news event can be found <a href="https://2009legacy.github.io/site/wiki/misc/2021-Easter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. 
                                         
                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        <blockquote>
                                            While walking through the grand exchange admiring the adventure bots you notice something glowing <br> <br>

                                            As you approach the object you notice it seems to be a container <br><br>

                                            <b>YOU ARE PERMITTED!</b> <br><br>

                                            <b>You have two weeks from this moment or the world will be erased, stop the super egg from siphoning the energy from Gielinor and every adventurer that does their part will be rewarded</b>
                                            <br><br>
                                            Ryan faints as the voice booms
                                            <br><br>
                                            You look as the container opens containing an incredibly daunting task ahead, can we solve it in time?
                                            <br><br>
                                        </blockquote>

                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        As the quote above talks about solving the puzzle you will have the chance to work together to go through the trials that Kermit has in place. I really hope everyone can 
                                        come together and enjoy this great event for the super egg!

                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        If you do participate, you will recieve a new discord role for the event called the <b>Super Egg 2020 </b> role.
                                     </p>

                                    
                                
                                     <h3>Staffing Changes</h3>
                                     <p>We have had a few people get "demoted" but for nothing bad. They were just inactive and do have the chance of getting back in their role. 
                                        This is not guarenteed since newer people are always considered for a position but for now we have a at a good spot with staff. 

                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        Unless you have been living under a rock lately, you should have noticed that Ryan is no longer a regular member of the community. He was chosen 
                                        to be Community manager. Unlike our previous Community managers including myself, Ryan is also the new sysadmin. Ceikry left that specific role when he 
                                        took a vacation from the project. Ryan will more than likely stay this position until the day he leave.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        While our community was changing as well we had recruited a new developer to the team. Downthecrop has made a decent amount of changes to the website such as the 
                                        drop table tool and the jekyll addition for a more automated website. He has made slight server fixes as well including creating a mobile client for us to use. 
                                        If you would like to learn more about the mobile client click <a href="https://github.com/2009scape/2009Scape-mobile#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

                                        Bushtail has saved the day in the tech support by taking the Windows issues out of our hands and into his very own. He will run the Live Server Help section 
                                        for troubleshooting questions.

                                        <br>
                                        <br>

                                        Last but not least we have recruited a new helper/moderator to join our fields to make sure things are kept cleaned up. If you have any questions please make sure that you are asking them 
                                        or using the discord search bar. Please do not spam them other-wise I'll consider that a broken rule of harrassment. 
                                         
                                     </p>

                                        <h3>Contributors! To the Tributes!</h3>
                                        <p> Over the next week or so I will be updating the contributors ingame to have their clan chat rank. I know it's not much! but it's a small way to show that you are special to us! 
                                            While all our players are absolutely amazing, we do have a love for people who contribute. If you would like to see where we are currently at with bugs and content being worked on 
                                            check out the built in trello board that Gitlab has <a href="https://gitlab.com/2009scape/2009scape/-/boards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The tributes page 
                                            has also been updated to include all of the new contributors. Thank you so much for all the support!
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>Client Changes</h3>
                                        A new contributor named Pazzaz has come into our community and has shared his client knowledge with us by making a few additions to our client. One of them being 
                                        a much more smoother minimap by adding anti aliasing. You can also set your anti-alias to whatever you computer can handle creating a much smoother gameplay. 
                                        A lot more packets are slowly being renamed such as the OpenGL packets.
