      Hope everyone has had an amazing week while the server was down. I know many of you were missing 2009scape and I'm happy to say we are back 
    and now with a new update. To apoligize for the down time we are giving <b>five credits</b> to each person who claims them in #claim-to-fame in discord. 
    Under the community tab on the website you can find links to discord. If you do not believe in the politics
    of discord here is a link to the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#09-claimtofame:matrix.org">#claim-to-fame</a> for matrix.

<b>I wanted to point out that we hardly ever have down time this was something out of our Host's control and this isn't a common thing that happens so 
        do not worry one bit.
    </b>
<br/>
<br/>

      I would also like to state that x10 &amp; x20 accounts will have a postponed squish for the five days that were missed due to the server being down. 
    The new date for the squish is <b>October 11th</b> instead of October 4th.. If you are not aware of the squish you probably weren't here for the news post 
    so it won't really matter for your account.
