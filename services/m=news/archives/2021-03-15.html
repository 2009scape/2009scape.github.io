<p> Hi guys! There's a cute update once again this week for all of you to explore. We know with fixing the
    some of the old Arios code there was going to be some problems. However, <b style="color:darkred;">Ceikry</b>
    has been on the case and has fixed some of the bugs! He spends a bunch of time on this project to make sure each
    day new things can be added or fixed for a better overall experience for everyone. Okay, enough of my rambling
    time to bring on the real goods. </p>
