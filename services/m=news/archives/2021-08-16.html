    Hey guys! It has been two weeks since our last update but worry not! I made an announcement in discord and matrix talking 
    about doing a lot of backend work last week. These next few weeks will be an interesting few with our community preparing for 
    the next announcement that I will quote underneath.
    
    <br/>
<br/>
</p><blockquote>
        This has not been decided without some serious thought and feedback from very respected members of the community and of the project. 
      Over the next couple of months, some big changes are coming to the XP rates we offer. I do want to preface this with the fact that this is not a wipe. 
      See the details below: <br/><br/>
           All 10x and 20x accounts will have their experience squashed <b>down to the 5x equivalent</b> in 2 months' time. <b>(10/4/2021)</b> <br/>
          Squished accounts <b>will not</b> be eligible for the hall of fame. <br/>
          Squished accounts <b>will</b> be eligible to compete on the highscores. <br/>
          Squished accounts <b>will</b> keep all items and quests.  <br/> <br/>
<b>Why are we making this change?</b> <br/><br/>
          I, along with several other members of the community and staff, feel that these extremely high XP rates are ultimately harmful to the community and the game. 
        My observations over the last few months have confirmed this. There is a general correlation between higher xp rates sticking around for the least amount of 
        time. In other words, people who play on these very high rates tend to leave after a very short amount of time, usually because they accomplish all the goals
         they set for themselves relatively easily. For this reason, along with an imbalance in who can take hold of the resource market based on how quickly they can
          level and gather those resources, has brought us to the conclusion that removing these absurdly high rates is in the best interest of the game. 
          We have thought long and hard about what the best approach to this problem would be, and this is what we have come up with. It is my hope that 2 months 
          will be more than adequate for people to get their accounts into a position where they will not be harmed nearly as much by the squash of the XP, and I also
           hope it will allow many to keep their 99s. My interests always lie with what I believe is best for the long term health of the project. <br/>
<br/>
            I genuinely and deeply appreciate all of you and I hope I was able to reach an agreeable solution to this problem. 
            <br/>

<br/>
<br/>

        This change is going to make some differences within our community and while I know some people will decide to leave in the future 
      this will help our economy thrive. As well as people will tend to stick around longer since it's take them 4 times as long to do what 
      they would have done with the ridiculous xp rates. It was a mistake on our part to release such high experience rates We are a remake 
      that wants to fill the gap between osrs and rs3 while adding our twists from time to time. Unlike Jagex's Runescape, your player saves will 
      always be yours you just have to ask for them. We will make sure you will always have a forever home with 2009scape so stick around and watch 
      us progress! 

      <br/>
<br/>
<b><u>New Staff Member</u></b>
<br/>
<br/>
        On a more positive note, I would like to introduce our newest staff member Mico, they will be both our discord and ingame 
      moderator that will make sure that all the rules are kept and answer questions that us developers are frankly just exhausted answering 
      over and over again. Hoping this exhaustion does not carry on to them but please show the same respect you do for our other staff 
      since they will not go out of their way to make your playing experience terrible. Mico's job is to make sure that the game is fair 
      for everyone. If you have any questions at all feel free to ask Mico, and they will respond to you once they are able to. 
      
      
      <br/>
<br/>
<b><u>Launcher Updates</u></b>
<br/>
<br/>
        Two weeks ago I had told myself to add a section to the update post that talked about our newest launcher. 
      The previous update from two weeks ago the launcher got a brand new settings menu. The menu allowed for options 
      which you could previously do editing the config file this just gives you a pretty gui to do it which in the end 
      makes it more user friendly. 
      <br/>
<br/>
      First, you have the menu for debug settings
      <ul>
<li>Toggle Item I.ds</li>
<li>Toggle Npc I.ds</li>
<li>Toggle Object I.ds</li>
</ul>
      This may not seem super important but when making a bug report information about the object, npc, or item that is not working 
      saying the i.d will shed time off the developer's hand trying to figure out which you are referring to. 
      <br/>
<br/>
      Second, you have the right click settings.
      <ul>
<li>Toggle Rs3-Style menu border</li>
<li>Change right-click background color</li>
<li>Change right-click background opacity</li>
<li>Change right-click title bar color</li>
<li>Change right-click title bar font color</li>
<li>Change right-click title bar opacity</li>
<li>Change right-click border color</li>
<li>Change right-click border opacity</li>
</ul>
     
      Misc settings
      <ul>
<li>Change the Login theme music</li>
<li>Toggle xp drops</li>
<li>Change the xp drop mode</li>
<li>Change the track mode for xp</li>
<li>Toggle slayer tracker</li>
<li>Change the slayer tracker color</li>
<li>Change the slayer tracker opacity</li>
</ul>
      
      Now we have this week's launcher Updates
      <ul>
<li>Added settings tab for launcher itself</li>
<li>Can toggle launcher closing on client start</li>
<li>Can no longer edit the changelog text area</li>
<li>Added a toggable automatic check for launcher updates</li>
<li>Improved some visuals</li>
</ul>
<b><i>Quest #36</i></b>
        This was an unexpected turn of events for this week for me at least. This week our Lead developer has 
      casually been working on the Nature Spirit quest and has completed it! We now have our 36th quest so for 
      the people who have your quest capes. You better pack your bags and go off on a quest!
