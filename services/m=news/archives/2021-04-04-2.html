A late post on my part sorry guys but I wanted to make sure there was another place for our updates to go 
                                    rather than just keeping them on Discord. With everything going on from the U.S government trying to "outlaw" crypto
                                    to fight against a popular website <a href="https://odysee.com"> Odysee </a> a website using the lbry core and 
                                    Microsoft attempting to buy discord may cause some tension for us using Discord (Myself included ) I will try to make 
                                    the update posts on time! Last time we just had way to many patches that we had to make so we couldn't get a proper page 
                                    going for it.

<b><u> Content Additions </u></b>
<br/>
<p>
                                        The addition this time around is the start to a magic system so another core update 
                                        vs the old system we had that was a tad wonky. We'll see more than this over time obviously but here is the start! 
                                    </p>
