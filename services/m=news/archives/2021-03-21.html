<!-- Post goes right in here -->
<p> It's inching closer to the end of March and we just had three big updates back to back and now we have another one! Exciting news on this part is this 
    update is an update that was planned out accordingly and has a beautiful new addition to our 2009scape. So, let me not talk up a storm this isn't discord
    after all this is our website.

<b><u> Content Additions </u></b>
<br/>
<p>
      The time is here, our credit wallets are completely full and some of us got our streaks for voting and some got our new Hall of fame titles. 
      If only there was a shop to where we could spend these beautiful credits? oh wait.. A shop you say? Look not further! we have a brand new shop
      with new ways of earning credits! Last update I went into a few details of what was added inside our Random events; however, our credit
      system is so big that I needed to write an entire other page explaining how to get them! Check this out <a href="../../../site/game_guide/credits.html"> <b>HERE</b></a>.
