<b>Where can I get runes?</b>
<br><br>
There are a number of ways in which you are able to obtain runes, as shown below:<br>
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; "><br>
<li>Make them yourself, through the use of the <a href="runecrafting_the_basics.html"><b>Runecrafting Skill.</b></a><br>
<li>Runes may be bought from other players.<br>
<li>Runes are often dropped by monsters on their death.<br>
<li>Runes can often be found within chests.<br><li>Runes may be bought from the rune shops in Varrock and Port Sarim.<br>
<li>Runes may be bought from the Magic Guild.<br>
<li>Runes may be bought from the Mage Arena.<br>
<li>Runes may be bought from <a href="rogue_trader.html">Ali M</a>.<br>
<li>Runes can be stolen/bought from Ape Atoll.<br>
</ul>
<br><br>
<b>What affects my magic defence?</b>
<br><br>
Magic defence depends on your Magic skill level, Defence level and equipment you are wearing.
<br><br>
The higher your skill levels and Magic bonus, the less likely you are to get hit. You will also receive less damage from a spell.
<br><br>
<b>What affects my magic damage?</b>
<br><br>
Certain staves and wands can increase the magic damage that you cause while wielding them.
<br><br>
The following items all increase magic damage by 10%:
<ul>
<li>Ahrim's Staff</li>
<li>Ancient Staff</li>
<li>Corrupt Zuriel's Staff</li>
<li>Master wand</li>
<li>Void Knight Mace</li>
<li>Zuriel's Staff</li>
</ul>
The staff of light increases magic damage by 15%.
<br><br>
You can also get a percentage increase to your magic damage if your magic level is boosted beyond its actual level (by drinking potions, for example). The percentage increase can be calculated by taking the number of levels you have boosted and then multiplying it by 3. For example, the extreme magic potion gives 21% extra magic damage, which is 7 boosted levels multiplied by 3. As the boost to your magic level reduces, so will this percentage decrease.
<br>
<br>
<b>How does experience work for my Magic skill?</b>
<br><br>
You get a certain amount of experience points for actually casting a spell, the quantity of experience depends on which spell you cast.
<br><br>
If you cast a combat spell like crumble undead, though, you will get experience for casting the spell and also experience for the damage done to the monster.
<br><br><br>
<b>How does Wizard's Mind Bomb work?</b>
<br><br>
If your Magic level is 49 or below, the Mind Bomb will increase it temporarily by 2 levels. If your Magic level is above 49, your level will be boosted 3 levels temporarily.
<br><br><br>
<b>Do area effect attacks cause damage to people wearing the same wilderness cape as me in Clan Wars?</b>
<br><br>
Yes, all area effect attacks will cause damage to anyone in the blast area while playing Clan Wars. Wearing a wilderness cape does not stop you from taking damage. It only stops anyone who has the same cape on from having 'Attack' as their default option when they click on you.
<br><br><br>
<b>If I cast the 'confuse' spell twice in a row, will my opponent's attack be reduced by 10% instead of 5?</b>
<br><br>
You cannot cast a spell that lowers an opponent's statistics on a player who is already suffering from the effects of that spell.
<br><br><br>
<b>I have my spell book set to Ancient Magicks and want to become a free-to-play player, do I have to change it back to normal Magic or will it be locked?</b>
<br><br>
When your subscription expires and your credits are depleted, the spell book will change to normal Magic on its own. If you enter a free world before your subscription expires it will be locked and you will be unable to use it.
<br><br><br>
<a name="Enchanted_Amulets_and_Necklaces"></a><br class="clear">
<div class="headings">
<span class="headertitleleft"><span class="headertitleright">Enchanted Amulets and Necklaces</span></span>
</div> <br><br>
<b>What does the binding necklace do?</b>
<br><br>
The binding necklace allows combination runes to be crafted without failing. It will work 15 times until it breaks or disappears.
<br><br><br>
<b>What does the games necklace do?</b>
<br><br>
When this item is first made, it will have eight charges in it.
<br><br>
A player may choose to activate the power of the necklace to teleport them from whatever location they are in RuneScape (though not from within the deep Wilderness) to the Barbarian Outpost, the games room in the basement of Burthorpe Castle, the Wilderness volcano or Clan Wars.
<br><br>
Once all of the eight charges are used, the item will crumble to dust, meaning that you must choose to either buy or make a new one.
<br><br><br>
<b>How do I recharge my amulet of glory?</b>
<br><br>
You will need to dip the amulet of glory into the fountain at the Heroes' Guild to give the amulet 4 teleport charges.
<br><br><br>
<br><a name="Enchanted_Rings"></a><br class="clear">
<div class="headings">
<span class="headertitleleft"><span class="headertitleright">Enchanted Rings</span></span>
</div> <br><br>
<b>What does the ring of stone do?</b>
<br><br>
The ring of stone grants you the ability to turn yourself into a rock, any attempts to do anything other than type via the chat box will cause the user to return to normal.
<br><br>
It may also have other magical abilities which are unknown at this time. <br><br><br>
<b>What power does the ring of wealth give you?</b>
<br><br>
The ring of wealth increases the chance of getting a rare drop when you kill a monster. You will never get items that are not normally dropped by that monster (e.g. a dragon medium helmet from a chicken) but you may get something that the monster seldom drops.
<br><br>
Things like Treasure Trail rewards and Barrows rewards, which aren't monster drops, are not affected by the ring of wealth.
<br><br><br>
<b>If I buy a ring of recoil from another player, is there any way for me to tell if it has been used a lot and is about to shatter? Or, when it is passed to someone else (traded), does it start new fully charged?</b>
<br><br>
It doesn't matter how many times someone else has used a ring of recoil, as any ring you wear will be able to deal as much damage as the last ring you wore (unless you have completely used one and then put on a new one).
<br><br>
The ring of recoil will shatter once it has dealt 400 damage, it will only deal damage when the person wearing it is being hurt. If you were to deal 200 damage with one ring of recoil and then switch to another ring - that second ring will shatter after 200.
<br><br>
If another player had previously worn the second ring and dealt 390 points of damage, then given it to you, it will still shatter for you after 20 uses.
<br><br><br>
<b>What does the ring of forging do?</b>
<br><br>
If you are wearing the ring of forging it will allow you to smelt 140 iron ore with a 100% success rate.
<br><br><br>
<b>What does the ring of duelling do?</b>
<br><br>
If you rub this item you will have the choice of being teleported to the Al Kharid Duel Arena, Fist of Guthix, the Mobilising Armies Command Centre or to the Castle Wars lobby. However, you cannot use the ring of duelling to teleport if you are too deep in the Wilderness.
<br><br>
The ring of duelling has 8 uses
<br><br><br>
<b>My ring of life did not teleport me back to Lumbridge, why?</b>
<br><br>
The ring of life will not work in the deeper parts of the Wilderness, nor in the Duel Arena. It also does not protect you if your health drops from 10% to 0% in one hit.
<br><br><br>
<br><a name="Mage_Arena"></a><br class="clear">
<div class="headings">
<span class="headertitleleft"><span class="headertitleright">Mage Arena</span></span>
</div> <br><br>
<b>What rewards do I get from the Mage Arena?</b>
<br><br>
You can get three different staves from the Mage Arena. These are the staves of the three gods. You have to finish this game before you can choose one of these staves.
<br><br>
Once you have completed the game, you can pick either the staff of Guthix, Saradomin or Zamorak. Before you can use these staves and the spells outside of the Arena you need to cast the spell that belongs with your staff 100 times. This will cost you 200 blood runes as well as the other runes involved. This means it is a very expensive staff to acquire, but wielding the staff of a god is an impressive feat.
<br><br><br>
<b>Do I need to take anything with me?</b>
<br><br>
It is recommended that you take 300+ chaos, air and fire runes. Items of clothing which will increase your Magic, good food and a knife.
<br><br><br>
<b>What level Magic do I need to start the Mage Arena?</b>
<br><br>
The Mage Arena is located in the Deep Wilderness so will be a dangerous trip. To access the arena you need to have a Magic level of 60.
<br><br><br>
<b>There are spider webs blocking my way into the Arena, how do I get past them?</b>
<br><br>
Now is a good time to use that knife on those webs.
<br><br><br>
<b>Is it possible to get another staff after I have selected my first staff?</b>
<br><br>
If you speak to the Chamber Guardian you can purchase the other staves for 80,000 coins each.
<br><br><br>
<b>I have lost my cape of Saradomin/Zamorak/Guthix and I was wondering if there was any way of getting it back?</b>
<br><br>
You can go back to the Altar of your chosen god and receive another cape, or choose a different Altar to receive the cape of one of the other gods.
<br><br><br>
<b>If I have combination runes and normal runes in my inventory and I cast a spell, which runes will the spell use up?</b>
<br><br>
You will automatically use the fewest runes possible. So, if you were to cast fire blast (which requires 5 fire runes, 4 air runes and a death rune) while carrying smoke runes (fire and air combination rune), fire runes, air runes and death runes, you would automatically use 4 smoke runes, 1 fire rune and a death rune.
