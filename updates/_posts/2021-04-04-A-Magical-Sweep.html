A late post on my part sorry guys but I wanted to make sure there was another place for our updates to go 
rather than just keeping them on Discord. With everything going on from the U.S government trying to "outlaw" crypto
to fight against a popular website <a href="https://odysee.com"> Odysee </a> a website using the lbry core and 
Microsoft attempting to buy discord may cause some tension for us using Discord (Myself included ) I will try to make 
the update posts on time! Last time we just had way to many patches that we had to make so we couldn't get a proper page 
going for it.

<br/>
<b><u> Content Additions </u></b>
<br/>
<p>
  The addition this time around is the start to a magic system so another core update 
  vs the old system we had that was a tad wonky. We'll see more than this over time obviously but here is the start! 
</p>
                                    
A few more things have been added as well check them out in this list!
<ul>
  <li> Magic has started a transition to a new system which will bring more flexibility with fixing + improving magic.</li>
  <li> Alchemy spell moved to new system and separated out from handling for Mage Training Arena alchemy </li>
  <li>Bones to Bananas and Bones to Peaches tablets now function (Can use B2P tablet without unlocking the spell)</li>
