<p>2009scape Hiscores</p>
<p>
  Those who have been with us for a while know 2009scape has been through a lot.
  Originally hosted the game without a launcher, spotty connections, server down 12
  hours a day, no website, open source but not accepting contributions.. It was a
  rough time.
</p>
<p>
  But we made the best of it! RedSparr0w, one of the earlier developers, created a
  2009scape Discord and our Discord Bot, which contained a mini hiscores channel.
  We've used that for over a year now, but now we've got something better..
</p>
<p>
  <b><u>Introducing Hiscores:</u></b>
</p>

<p>
  These hiscores introduce sorting players by top stats overall, seeing your own
  stats, as well as filters for xp rate and ironman modes. Almost everything from the
  real 2009 hiscores is working there, all with a great theme and UI that matches what
  you'd expect it to be.
</p>
<p>
  We'll be monitoring the hiscores closely for any inconsistencies and making sure
  everything works as expected over the next couple days. If you spot something that
  looks off, give me a shout on Discord or any other admin in-game and we'll get it
  fixed.

  Head over to the <a href="/services/m=hiscore/hiscores.html">Hiscores Page</a>
  now and check it out! It's also accessible from the Community dropdown in the
  navigation bar at the top.

<p>And for those who are curious, here's what our old hiscores looked like...</p>
