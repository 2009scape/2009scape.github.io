  The 2009scape team is thrilled to be with you all another year. The spirit of
  2009scape will live with us forever, and the skills and XP players earned will shine
  on the <a href="/services/m=hiscore/hiscores.html">Hiscores</a> for years and
  years. This year, we had prepared a special little countdown event for those who
  were on Christmas day, and inspired by the Falador Guards' excitement for drop
  parties, the GE went absolutely wild!
</p>
<p>We wish everyone a safe and fulfilling year, and look forwards to being with you all next one.</p>
