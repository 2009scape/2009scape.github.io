<p>Greetings Explorers</p>
<p>A lot has changed over the last month resulting in a pretty beefy update. Thanks to redwood for their contributions. This update brings a few new quests, music to our ears (literally, check the SFX changes), fixes, reworks and other brand new content.  A full list of the changes are below:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Temporarily disabling Blast Furnace</li>
  <li>Corrected TFT method call</li>
  <li>Fixed some ContentAPI issues introduced by !410</li>
  <li>added unique Zandar Horfyre NPC dialogue and interaction</li>
  <li>Refactored god item definitions to be more general purpose</li>
  <li>Fixed achievement related NPEs in ClimbActionHandler</li>
  <li>Improved the behavior of trying to interact with moving entities (such as tool leprechauns, pick-pocketing farmers, etc.)</li>
  <li>Implemented make-x for potatoes/pizzas/breads</li>
  <li>Can now catch implings with use of a hunter potion</li>
  <li>The Fremmenik Trials quest has been completed, now accesible in-game<br />

  <br />
  Giant Mole's Burrow mechanic corrected in functionality. Burrow: When the mole's health is between 5-50%, there is a 25% chance for any incoming attack to cause it to burrow away into another location. There is also a chance that the dirt she digs while burrowing to escape can extinguish the player's light source (shown with dirt splatters on the player's screen), though covered light sources will be unaffected by this.<br />
  <br />
  Mole Lair's unique music track now correctly plays across the entirety of the Mole Lair region<br />
  <br />
