  2009scape is developed by tonnes of open source contributors, so as long as an
  update isn't <i>negative</i> to the game or the codebase, it usually goes in.
  Sometimes, that gives us weird and quirky things.

<p>
  Candybox is an old Browser game like 2009scape - so we added it to our website! You
  can play it by visiting this <a href="../../../site/candybox/index.html">secret
  link</a>. It's an idle game, so play it while you play Scape in the background!
