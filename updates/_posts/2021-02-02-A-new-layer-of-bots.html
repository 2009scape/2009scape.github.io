<p>Runescape's economy was always based on bots.</p>
<p>
  Since Runescape Classic, bots have been a part of the game (heck, they're even the
  reason Runescape Classic was played for so long!). With the recent addition of bot
  worlds over at OpenRSC (another great Runescape project), we've decided to take the
  same step forwards.
</p>
<p>
  We've always had bots in the game populating the GE, keeping the game feeling alive,
  so much so that when we removed them players rioted in Falador. But instead of
  playing a cat and mouse game (with some of our own developers, even), we decided to
  unlock them for all; going forwards, <b>everyone can bot</b>.
</p>
<p>
<i><b>But I worked so hard!!</b></i>
</p>
<p>
  Fear not! Players who bot, even once will be permanently removed from the default
  hiscores, and we're looking at other ways of tagging them too. Authentic accounts
  will forever be respected and honored, just as they were before. Think twice
  before enabling this on your main!
</p>

<p>To start botting, type</p>
<pre>::scripts</pre>in-game to see a list of scripts. Have a script you'd like to see?
Fork the project, write it up and submit a PR! Also, please note more scripts are planned to be added in the future, this is mostly just the groundwork.
