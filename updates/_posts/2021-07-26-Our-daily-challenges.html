  It is absolutely bat-shit bonkers that it's already the end of July. Who would have thought we would be ending 
  this last update of July with such an amazing list of updates! Well, I did because our developers and contributors are amazing 
  and they get SHIT done! I would like to speak about the elephant in the room - Preservation. I just want to make this very 
  clear that for now we are only focused on Legacy. As stated in previous updates, Legacy has a x1 mode and does qualify you 
  to aim towards the Hall of Fame. So much amazing content has been being push to Legacy including this week's content as well. 
  So, put on your programming socks, goggles, and boot up those arch linux pcs and get ready to be amazed. All jokes aside, I love 
  how much love and dedication goes into this project.
