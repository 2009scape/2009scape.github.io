<p>Greetings Explorers</p>
<p><b>As of this update, in-game player abuse reports are now functional. All reports will be read by staff.</b></p>
<p>Full list of changes in Gielinor:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Corrected grave timers</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where swamp toads never respawned<br />
  Set a respawn_delay for swamp toad npc to 34 ticks (20 seconds)</li>
  <li>Fixed the exit tunnel teleport of Guthix/TDS cave to return the player to Lumbridge cave instead of lv50+ wilderness ladder</li>
  <li>Added the ability to award credits from a CSV file with an ingame command (ADMIN)<br />
  Added the ability to modify an individual user's credits (PMOD)<br />
  Added ContentAPI methods for working with credits<br />
  Corrected a source of syntactic confusion in the login decoder (no actual change in behavior)</li>
  <li>Corrected leaf-bladed sword requirements to attack 50 and slayer 55</li>
  <li>Corrected xp reward for thieving yanille watchmen</li>
  <li>Fixed a potential exploit where pvp-specific behaviors were being taken into account for PvM, resulting in potential non-halberd melee safespots</li>
  <li>Deduplicated drop table and npc config jsons</li>
  <li>Re-added explicit Kotlin notice to README</li>
  <li>Added worldprops option noauth_default_admin so admin-by-default can be disabled when use_auth = false, thus making it possible to have singleplayer builds where the player is not automatically given admin rights</li>
  <li>Fixed beer keg effects, now authentically -40 attack and +10 str bonus</li>
  <li>Pharaoh's Sceptre<br />
  <br />

  <li>Implemented Report Abuse button - players can now submit reports to staff</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous moderation QoL improvements</li>
  <li>Made the PulseManager capable of running multiple pulses simultaneously, in different slots (this makes it function a bit more like an entity queue, though not quite)<br />
  Fixed the dupe in the ectofuntus by demoting the action pulses for grinding bones from world pulses to individual pulses, and correcting a bit of the logic<br />
  Added function to remove multiple attributes at once to the ContentAPI</li>
