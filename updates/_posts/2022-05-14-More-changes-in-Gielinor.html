<ul>
  <li>selling items for tokkul now returns the correct amount of tokkul (10x less)</li>
  <li>fixed Family Crest bug where Dimintheis would not replace gauntlets if you lost them (fixes #312)<br />
  fixed Family Crest bug where Dimintheis would give you infinite gauntlets (fixes #257)<br />

  added content API function for checking if a player possesses any particular items anywhere<br />
  added content API functions for starting and finishing quests</li>
  <li>implemented seaweed nets at fishing colony, but also locked it behind the appropriate quest (which isn't implemented yet, so no real change for players yet)<br />
