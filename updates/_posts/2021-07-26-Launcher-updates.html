  Since the Github Launcher links kept confusing people into wondering which launcher was the correct one to download we have decided 
  to remove the list. With this being said we do not want to destroy our history of information on updates were what so this will be a post 
  showing all the different launcher updates!

  (Also, bug me on Discord if the client won't connect. I'll restart the server.

<b><u>2009scape Release 1.0</u></b>

  <br>
  The live server is probably going to have another reset but here's a client to connecting it so people can test things out. Good luck and have fun!
  <br>
  <br>
  Note: These are huge downloads because they include the server code in them for now... Just uh, ignore that.
