<p> 
  &nbsp; It has been quite a long while since our last update! But I am happy to say that we are back at it again with a brand new update! And.... I am 
  a tad late on this Update Post! My deepest apologies.

  &nbsp; This update would not be possible without the contributors in our community. It's honestly an amazing sight to see when open source community
  comes together to release a bunch of content and fixes! I just want to give a huge shout out to our contributors these last couple of weeks. Fractals, 
  Downthecrop, Tibmage, James T, and Crash! It's so nice to see everyone coming together and knocking down some content.

  &nbsp; Time has run out for x20 & x10 accounts and the accounts will be squished. I hope everyone 
  got the stats they wanted before being squished down to the x5 xp rate. We gave about two months to prepare so there really is not any excuse 
  that you were not given enough time. If you would like to learn more about it check <a href="{% post_url /updates/2021-08-16-A-fair-start-part-2 %}">here</a>.

  <b>Vinesweeper</b>
  <br/>
  <br/>

  &nbsp; I wanted to start this update post strong with the newest big addition to our game. Vinesweeper is a Farming and Hunter minigame that acts a lot like the 
  old computer game Minesweeper. It takes place on Winkin's farm which can be accessed by talking to any Tool Leprechaun near farm patches. Check out this video 
  on how the minigame works!
