<h2 id="hardcore-ironman-rework">Hardcore Ironman Rework</h2>
<p>Our community has voted to implement some changes to the Hardcore Ironman (HCIM) game mode. </p>
<h4 id="these-changes-only-apply-to-hardcore-ironmen-created-after-december-15th-2021-">These changes only apply to hardcore ironmen created AFTER December 15th 2021.</h4>
<p>New HCIM will get a truly single life experience. Death is permanent. There is <b>NO</b> continuing as a normal ironman. <a href="https://gitlab.com/2009scape/2009scape/-/issues/227">#227</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>On death, your account is <b>completely wiped</b>. </li>
  <li>Hardcore Ironmen are the only account type permitted to play on 10x experience.</li>
  <li>&quot;Safe Deaths&quot; in minigames and related activities are still safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can handle the challenge, there is an ongoing event in the <b>#pdim-bingo</b> channel. Event rewards and information pinned! </p>

<p>The poll has finally passed! Secondary bank accounts are now available for purchase for 5M. <a href="https://gitlab.com/2009scape/2009scape/-/issues/251">#251</a></p>
