<p>Ready for some grave robbing?</p>
<p>
  East of Mort'ton lies the Barrows, the tombs of ancient warriors. Will you
  be able to find their hidden wealth?
</p>
<p>
  Barrows isn't new to 2009scape, but we've
  been making some updates to it! Droprate
  fixes, bug fixes, and other subtle
  authentic features we missed out the first
  time round while coding it. Over the
  weekend, players had a great time crashing
  the market with their newfound barrows
  pieces after the update, but Bob's Axe
  shop is expecting some profit down the
  line as well.
</p>
<p>
  In a short interview, Bob said that he
  "expects reckless adventureres" to ruin
  their armor, and "come to me when they
  have a problem".
