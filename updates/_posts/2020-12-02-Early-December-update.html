<p>Ever want to know your stats?</p>
<p>
  We've added an all-new ingame ::stats system! Don't worry, it doesn't affect
  gameplay in any way. It's just a bit of fun that added to the list of fun exclusive stuff of 09- So
  have some fun with it!

  In addition, we've added some Christmas theming, and some of the adventurers around
  the game have been given some additional spirit. You'll want to be around on certain
  dates this month to see it
