  Hi guys! There's a cute update once again this week for all of you to explore. We know with fixing the
  some of the old Arios code there was going to be some problems. However, <b style="color:darkred;">Ceikry</b>
  has been on the case and has fixed some of the bugs! He spends a bunch of time on this project to make sure each
  day new things can be added or fixed for a better overall experience for everyone. Okay, enough of my rambling
  time to bring on the real goods.
