<p>Greetings Explorers</p>
<p>There have been some BIG changes in Gielinor. Please pay careful attention.</p>
<p>The grand exchange has received a massive upgrade. The Grand Exchangers have found some lost offers under the desk. Any offers you have made in the past that the Grand Exchangers lost will start showing up. When you login with empty offer slots, any previously lost offers will start showing up in these slots.</p>
<p>Some other highlights include an authentic Tutorial Island, a personalised and dynamically adjusted shop system, pyramid plunder minigame rewrite plus a new quest (Tribal Totem). Full changes as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show standard offer text when reopening already-made offers<br />
  Fixed grand exchange offers disappearing on login<br />
  Don't show withdraw items with amount 0</li>
  <li>Fixes for 'perfect gold' smelting, mining and a prospecting bug for depleted rocks</li>
  <li>Updated Java 8 to Java 11 in README.md, updated links</li>
  <li>fixed memleak in ge sqlite connection</li>
  <li>Add npc configs entry for ignoring tolerance</li>
  <li>NPCs can no longer teleport you out of bounds</li>
  <li>NPCs should no longer be able to kill you with a projectile fired shortly before or during death</li>
  <li>Locked some cells in port sarim jail, can no longer just walk into wormbrain's cell</li>
  <li>Implemented charter cost reduction for karamja gloves</li>
  <li>thieving: Pickpocket sound, hit sounds, fixed stun</li>
  <li>Pets now run off when starving</li>
  <li>MapAreas can now reference their associated zones to dynamically add/remove borders<br />
  Random Events can no longer spawn in fishing trawler<br />
  Players can no longer have multiple random events spawned in/active at a time</li>
  <li>Plugin interactions can now dispatch interaction events, fixes varrock easy diary tasks not counting</li>
  <li>Convert skillcape perk activation to an interaction listener, fixes HP cape giving perm boost</li>
  <li>Fixed agility interruptible obstacles and repeating low walls</li>
  <li>Implemented the varrock teleport destination swap reward for easy diary completion<br />
  Fixed the bug with accessing ned's achievement dialogue while one of his quests was in progress</li>
  <li>Added unit testing framework</li>
  <li>Added info on synth names and quest prefixes</li>
  <li>swapped to java 11</li>
  <li>fixed erroneous pyramid plunder locks</li>
  <li>Completely rewrote the shop system.<br />
  Shop restocking now works properly, with per-item-in-shop granularity as well. (Thanos tool update released that allows defining this)<br />
  Shops properly restrict ironmen from buying from player stock/overstocked items<br />
  Fully functioning individualized player stock support (need to set a server config variable to enable, disabled by default. Specifically, set personalized_shops = true in the world section of the config.)<br />
  The shop pricing formula now scales up/down with the authentic ratios based on stock quantity.<br />
  Buying or selling, for example, 1000 of an item, now does the proper calculation for each individual item in the purchase/sale rather than exchanging the full 1000 for the initial price at the time. (For example, in the old shops, feather price at full stock was, say, 6gp. You could buy 1000 feathers at once for 6000gp. Authentically, the pricing for each feather should scale as the stock goes down. Now 1000 feathers at once costs a bit over 7k gp, despite the initial price remaining 6gp.)<br />
  General store player stock is now shared between all general stores</li>
  <li>Fix Tribal Totem bug where you could repeatedly claim quest rewards</li>
  <li>Add five (5) bot dialogue lines, handful of RS scam lines</li>
  <li>Better cache parsing, reading more data from cache instead of code/config defined values</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug with Gertrude's Cat where it would give you the wrong bucket back when feeding the cat</li>
  <li>fixed penguin spying errors</li>
  <li>Fix weird integer casting bug with pyramid plunder affecting drop rates</li>

  <li>Fixed getting stuck in GE item set interface</li>
  <li>Reimplemented the Culinomancer chest</li>
