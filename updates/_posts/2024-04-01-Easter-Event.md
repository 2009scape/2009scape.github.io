Greetings Explorers

Some eggs have been spotted around Gielinor...

- Eggs will spawn in a random town every 30 minutes
- Eggs will randomly appear whilst gaining XP
- Stomp/release eggs to discover the hidden loot inside
- The 5th egg broken will unlock an Easter music track
- The 10th egg broken will unlock the bunny Easter emote
- The 15th egg broken will drop a new black variant of bunny ears
- Every 5 eggs thereafter will reward the player with music tracks or random loot
- This event will run for the duration of April

Happy hunting!
