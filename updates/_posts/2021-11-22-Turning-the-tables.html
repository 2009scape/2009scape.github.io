<h3>Drop Table Tool</h3>
<p>To improve the accessibility of drop table information a search tool has been made to help. This tool can be used by players to search NPC/Monsters drops or find all sources of specific item and their odds. Hopefully with more direct interaction and transparency with this data we can work together to improve our accuracy to the 2009 era. </p>
