<p><h3 align="center"><b>Audio Team - Music, Sound Effects and the Sound Bank</b></h3></p>
<p>Now we've had a look at the visual side of things in the <a href="dev_diary02.html">Graphics Development Diary</a>, it's time to have a <i>listen</i> to the other side of asset production: audio development. Graphics are generally noticed first – when you log into the game, they're the first thing you experience – but although music and sound effects are more subtle, they play an equally important role in immersing you into a game. As the Greek philosopher Plato once said, <span class="quote">"Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything."</span></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>A prima vista</b></p>
<p>In comparison to our other development teams, the <span class="team">Audio</span> team itself is small, currently only consisting of three people – <span class="mod">Mod Ian</span>, <span class="mod">Mod Dan A</span> and <span class="mod">Mod Bond</span>. Despite being a small team, they have a wide range of musical talents, tastes and backgrounds, and between them have composed over 500 RuneScape songs and hundreds of sound effects.</p>
<p><span class="mod">Mod Ian</span>, the team leader, started out working on our <a href="customer_support-2.html"><span class="team">Customer Support</span></a> team, then switched to working fifty-fifty between <span class="team">Audio</span> and <span class="team">RuneScape Content</span> (the <a href="the_dig_site_members.html">Dig Site</a> quest was one of his) before moving over to Audio full-time. <span class="quote">"When I started, I basically just had to write lots of songs. Now I run the team,"</span> he says.</p>
<p><span class="mod">Mod Dan A</span> has been playing guitar for about twenty years, playing keyboard and composing electronic music for fifteen, and has been a member of a prog rock band for eight years or so. <span class="mod">Mod Bond</span> started playing the piano and composing aged five, and has also played the violin in several orchestras. Both of them have degrees in Music Technology.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="../../img/varrock/devdiary/diary03/piano.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="piano"><br><span class="caption">A piano.</span></p> <br>
<p><span class="quote">"Although physically we're separated from the rest of the company,"</span> says <span class="mod">Mod Bond</span>, referring to the soundproof area in which they work, <span class="quote">"in spirit and in practise, we're very much an integral part of the development process and of the complete RuneScape experience."</span></p>
<p>As with the <span class="team">Graphics</span> team, the <span class="team">Audio</span> team get involved in the development process very early. During a project's briefing stages, there is a planning meeting where the audio requirements are discussed – how many songs and sound effects, the feel and tone needed, etc. <span class="quote">"The music is usually then created when an area's 3D models are complete, and the sound effects when the animation is finished,"</span> says <span class="mod">Mod Ian</span>.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>And the beat goes on</b></p>
<p><span class="mod">Mod Bond</span> says, <span class="quote">"The inspiration for songs and effects largely comes from seeing the areas and animations themselves, once <span class="team">Graphics</span> have modelled them."</span> The audio brief from the content developer also contributes, though it's impact varies. <span class="quote">"Some developers are very specific about what they want, referencing certain themes, while others give us free reign to do whatever we feel is appropriate – both situations have their advantages,"</span> <span class="mod">Mod Bond</span> continues.</p>
<div style="float:left; width:30%; margin:15px; text-align: left;">
<p class="bigquote">
"Saxophones have a cheeky, raspy noise that reflects the goblins they represent."
</p>
<p>
<img src="../../img/varrock/devdiary/jmod.gif"><span class="mod">Mod Bond</span><br><span class="team">Audio</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="team">Audio</span> team also sometimes reuses themes – for instance, over the course of a long or multi-part quest, or attached to specific NPCs. The character of Zanik has her own theme, which has influenced some of the music from those quests she features in, to help reinforce the story. It's a well-known fact that music and memory are closely linked. <span class="quote">"Over time, we've established various instruments used to reflect certain RuneScape races – for example, saxophones have a cheeky, raspy noise that reflects the goblins they represent,"</span> says <span class="mod">Mod Bond</span>.</p>
<p>Once an audio developer has an idea of what they want to compose, it's over to the actual production. <span class="quote">"We use a commercial MIDI-sequencing program that allows us to record a sixteen-track song, which we hand-write using a MIDI keyboard controller,"</span> says <span class="mod">Mod Ian</span>. For those that don't know, MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is an industry-standard protocol for instruments and computers to communicate with each other.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="../../img/varrock/devdiary/diary03/loop_editor.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="loop editor"><br><span class="caption">A snare drum sound being prepared in the loop editor.</span></p> <br>
<p>The <span class="team">Audio</span> team also uses in-house software for other parts of the process, which aids them in keeping file sizes low. <span class="mod">Mod Dan A</span> explains: <span class="quote">"The loop editor is for taking the original, full quality sound samples and creating small, compressed loops from them. These loops are then passed into a patch editor, which allows us to arrange these loops onto our MIDI keyboards to play as an instrument, to compose the songs how we want."</span> The last piece of software the <span class="team">Audio</span> team uses, also in-house software, is used to create all of the game's sound effects. <span class="quote">"The tools we use were developed for us specially by <span class="mod">Mod Ben D</span> with <span class="mod">Andrew</span>'s assistance,"</span> says <span class="mod">Mod Ian</span>, <span class="quote">"we are grateful for all the hard work they have put in to make these facilities available for us - thanks guys!"</span></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="../../img/varrock/devdiary/diary03/patch_editor.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="patch editor"><br><span class="caption">A piano sound being used in the patch editor.</span></p> <br>
<p align="center"><b>The sound bank</b></p>
<p>The samples used in these pieces of software come from something called a sound bank. A sound bank is simply a collection of sounds that follow a general MIDI standard, which can be used to construct a piece of music or a sound effect. As with <span class="team">Graphics</span> and <span class="team">RuneScape Content</span>, the <span class="team">Audio</span> team also has its own set of improvement projects, one of which was creating our own Jagex sound bank – this resulted in having to rework and tweak the 500+ existing songs.</p> <p>The Jagex sound bank is split up into an instrument bank of 128 instrument sounds (brass, wind, string, etc.) and 9 different drum kits (totalling 58 drums), and because it's our own custom sound bank we're able to add some unusual noises (e.g. the record scratch from the <a href="grim_tales_members.html">Grim Tales</a> quest). Before the addition of our own sound bank, how a song sounded relied upon the sound banks used by the soundcards in each of your computers. <span class="mod">Mod Dan A</span> says, <span class="quote">"One of the advantages is that, rather than each player hearing a bank of sounds generated by their soundcard, which might be different between each player, they now hear the Jagex sound bank, so the music will sound the same across all computers and Internet browsers."</span> – this include Macs, which previously had no sound at all!</p>
<div style="float:right; width:30%; margin:15px; text-align: left;">
<p class="bigquote">
"The sound bank could actually be compressed to, pretty much, fit on a single 1.44Mb floppy disk."
</p>
<p>
<img src="../../img/varrock/devdiary/jmod.gif"><span class="mod"><span class="mod">Mod Bond</span></span><br><span class="team">Audio</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>Now, every time a song or effect is played, the RuneScape game client dynamically downloads the sounds required to play it from the Jagex sound bank, so the <span class="team">Audio</span> team has to make sure to keep file sizes as small as possible – <span class="quote">"It's a major technical and creative challenge, working towards these tiny file sizes without creating a lot of audio noise. We have to use lots of hiding/masking and noise reduction techniques,"</span> says <span class="mod">Mod Dan A</span>. It is possible, though, as <span class="mod">Mod Bond</span> follows that up by saying, <span class="quote">"The sound bank could actually be compressed to, pretty much, fit on a single 1.44Mb floppy disk."</span></p>
<p>Aside from the sound bank, the <span class="team">Audio</span> team have worked on a number of other audio improvements – the area sounds (the wolf howls on White Wolf Mountain, birds twittering in the trees), syncing sound effects with animations (across several skills, e.g. chopping trees) – and the reasons for doing so reflect those behind the graphical and game improvements. Quite simply, as <span class="mod">Mod Ian</span> puts it, <span class="quote">"As new facilities become available to us, we use them!"</span></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>Audio appreciation society</b></p>
<p><span class="quote">"While we realise that not everyone may be interested in audio updates, we as a company always have to bear in mind that it's a complete gaming experience that we want to offer, and that includes updates to every aspect of the game, whether that be graphics, storylines, sound effects or even the website,"</span> says <span class="mod">Mod Ian</span>.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="../../img/varrock/devdiary/diary03/music_notes_thumb.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="music notes"><br><span class="caption">The music notes for 'Armageddon', the main theme tune for the God Wars Dungeon<br>Click the following for a larger, printable version: <a href="../../img/varrock/devdiary/diary03/music_notes_big1.gif" target="_new">bars 1 and 2</a>, <a href="../../img/varrock/devdiary/diary03/music_notes_big2.gif" target="_new">bars 3 and 4</a>, <a href="../../img/varrock/devdiary/diary03/music_notes_big3.gif" target="_new">bars 5 and 6</a>, <a href="../../img/varrock/devdiary/diary03/music_notes_big4.gif" target="_new">bars 7 and 8</a>.</span></p> <br>
<p><span class="quote">"Saying that, we aim to give players a high degree of control over the audio in the game, to cater to as many tastes as possible,"</span> says <span class="mod">Mod Ian</span>, <span class="quote">"a good example of which is the option to turn music, area sounds and sound effects on and off separately, so if players want to listen to their own music but still hear sound effects, they can."</span> On the flipside, he continues, <span class="quote">"For as many players that turn the music off, there's the same amount that turn it on, and have the desire to 'green light' (unlock) all of the songs in the song list."</span></p>
<p>Audio in games is often overlooked, being a subtler part of the overall experience, but most gamers appreciate that music can aid in enveloping them within a game, adding atmosphere and depth. Also, sound effects can not only help give a game a greater sense of reality, they can also provide useful cues, often more effectively than graphics can – e.g. the sound when your <a href="prayer.html">Prayer</a> points run out.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><b>Music: response</b></p>
<p>Having such varied tastes in music, each member of the <span class="team">Audio</span> team has their own favourite RuneScape songs. They have too many favourites to list them all, but here are a few.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="../../img/varrock/devdiary/diary03/penguin_mods.gif" style="display: block; margin: auto;" alt="penguin mods"><br><span class="caption">Mod Ian, Mod Bond and Mod Dan A - hard at work in the soundproof music room.</span></p> <br>
<p><span class="mod">Mod Ian</span>: <span class="quote">"My favourite themes are the <a href="keldagrim_members.html">Keldagrim</a> dwarves and the troll areas – I like the more comical and fun songs. I also like <span class="mod">Mod Dan A</span>'s '<a href="tarn_s_lair_members.html">Undead Dungeon</a>' – it clearly shows his darker tastes."</span></p>
<p><span class="mod">Mod Dan A</span>: <span class="quote">"Yes, I like the darker songs in the game; dramatic stuff, fighting music, etc. – songs that make you feel like you're on an adventure. My favourites are <span class="mod">Mod Ian</span>'s '<a href="brimhaven_agility_arena.html">Aztec</a>' and <span class="mod">Mod Bond</span>'s '<a href="armadyl_s_eyrie.html">Armadyl Alliance</a>' (from the <a href="godwars.html">God Wars Dungeon</a>)."</p>
<p><span class="mod">Mod Bond</span>: <span class="quote">"Yeah, I like the darker music too, such as <span class="mod">Mod Dan A</span>'s 'Undead Dungeon', but also the more melancholy themes and ballads like <span class="mod">Mod Ian</span>'s '<a href="lumbridge.html">Harmony</a>' – I really like my own '<a href="grim_tales_members.html">Fe Fi Fo Fum</a>' too (laughs). We also regularly check the <a href="../../../services.runescape.com/m%3dforum/forums.html">forums</a> for players' comments and are always interested in what their favourites are."</span></p>
