Keep in mind that our staff team are all volunteer and are not paid for their customer service.

Rule #2 of our server is to not disrespect any staff member.
While it's not severe for instant ban it is bannable if continued over and over.

We're here to build an amazing server and help anyone with any questions they may have of our server.
Do not ping a developer unless you are unable to login.

Thanks -

Staff Team
