    A brand new project has come out which will blow the socks off your feet like it has mine! Imagine walking around your favorite Runescape 

    cities and being able to Interact with the world around you! Now you can with a brand new group of mods for the VR Game Blade and Sorcery. 

    

    <br/>
<br/>



    It had all started with an artist named Connor who was just trying to dive into projects to work on his 3D modeling. He had released the map for Varrok 

    free of charge! and then more maps started taking off and more artists began to join in with him. Famous Youtubers like SoupRS had made videos about these 

    maps and I thought that everyone in the 09 community could appreciate it since these guys have gone out your way to not bring the game to you but bring you 

    into the game!

<br/>
<br/>



    The current project is working to bring all of these maps together as one big map to explore as if you would in the game. But that is still a bit a way and there 

    are really cool maps that you can hop in and out of using Blade and Sorcery's map system. With the physics of the B&amp;S engine you are able to maneuver around the maps 

    pretty well and even do osrs-like things like roof-top agility or picking up pots in general stores and trashing the place. Taking a stroll around lumbridge in vr 

    is surreal that you may never want to leave! If you are interested in the maps I will leave links to the maps below.

    After these mods were released Connor and his team moved on to work with getting closer to the world map we had discusssed earlier. Concepts of this are being 

    programmed/made towards the full map so far!

    Also one of his assistant artist as well, started working on a map for barbarian village. While there are no photos of what the map will look like completely there 

    is a snow filled version of this map that they had started

These pictures will change time to time as the project updates and I ( Summer ) have time to keep you guys updated on it. Currently they are working on a few 
different things like Draynor & Port Sarim ( model-wise ) and skills ( code-wise )

    We have made it to the end of this long thread but I am so glad I was able to share this amazing project with you. If you're a modeler, I believe you can join their 

    discord and offer to help with any of the projects or just jump in and tell them that you're grateful this exists.
