<h3>The Founder </h3>
<p id="bracket"><img height="100" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/staff_images/bracket.webp" style="border:black 1px solid; border-radius: 50%; " width="100"/> <b>Bracket</b>
    <br/>
    <br>
    
        &nbsp; Red Bracket is the founder of 2009scape. He is officially <b>retired </b> and the community is led by the group of admins underneath. Unlike Jagex with Andrew Gower, Bracket is always welcome in the community and isn't casted out. He did his part 
    and now he has chosen to work on his own projects moving forward. 
    
        </p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
<h3>The Admins</h3>
<br>
The Core Members of 2009scape. Either have been around the longest or they have gained a per say for how much they have put into the Project.
<br>
<br>
<p id="ceikry">
<img height="100" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/staff_images/ceikry.webp" style="border:black 1px solid; border-radius: 50%; " width="100"/> <b>Ceikry</b>
<br/>
<br>
    &nbsp; Ceikry is the lead developer and Admin of 2009scape. He has been around since late 2019 and has put well over 3000 hours into this project over the span of 2 years.
    At one point this was a full 8-12 hour day job until he took a break and came back in early 2022 after a month cool down. He is no longer sysadmin for his own mental 
    health but still respected as the top. He has put the most work into the project. 

 </p>

<p id="ryan"><img height="100" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/staff_images/ryan.webp" style="border:black 1px solid; border-radius: 50%; " width="100"/> <b>Ryan</b>
    <br/>
    <br>
    
          Ryan has been with the community for awhile. You may know him as the guy linked to the joke about Barbarian Assault. Despite all the jokes 
          people may or may not have with him he still holds a position to be respected. He is acting Community manager and sysadmin as of January of 2022. 
          If you have any concerns with player files he would be the one to go to. 
    
        </p>

<p id="woah"><img height="100" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/staff_images/woah.webp" style="border:black 1px solid; border-radius: 50%; " width="100"/> <b>Woahscam</b>
<br/>
<br>

     &nbsp; Up until April of 2022, Woah has been the host of 2009scape behind the scenes. He was running the magic behind his home server until he could no longer host. 
     One of the most respected members and high ranking players as of 2022 and continues to work behind the scenes. He is a client developer and the official cache editor. 
     If you ever see him please pay your thanks for the hosting he has provided over the years. We love you woah!

<p id="summer"><img height="100" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/staff_images/summer.webp" style="border:black 1px solid; border-radius: 50%; " width="100"/> <b>Summer</b>
<br/>
<br>
        
        My name is Summer, I am the website developer (sort of) that has had some amazing help from Downthecrop by automating github with Jekyll. I am an admin for 2009scape and 
        I was the first community manager of the project. I personally think I can be friendly but I am very big on rules. As a business owner, I am very by the book when it comes 
        to how I want my workspace to function so there are times where I can be ruthless with the ban button. If you guys need anything within means you can always ask me.

<h3>The Developers</h3>
<p id="kermit"><img height="100" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/staff_images/kermit.webp" style="border:black 1px solid; border-radius: 50%; " width="100"/> <b>Kermit</b>
    <br/> 
    <br> 
    Kermit is the Event Planner for 2009scape. As of April 2022, he became the new volunteer host which alone is an amazing thing to contribute. But he's not known for his 
    hoppin parties or hosting. He is known for his bots. The Pest control bots was the first big project that Kermit worked on under the guidance of Ceikry. After the 200 hour 
    Pest Control project he began work on <a href="../game_guide/adventurebots.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventure bots</a>. He also made the fishing bots 
    found at the Fishing Guild. Make sure you say hi from time to time! he is super friendly. 
    <br/>
    <br/>

<p id="downthecrop"><img height="100" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/staff_images/downthecrop.webp" style="border:black 1px solid; border-radius: 50%; " width="100"/> <b>Downthecrop</b>
        <br/> 
        <br> 
        Downthecrop is a Youtuber/Twitch streamer that fell upon this project one day while leaving a closed source 06 server. He was able to edit the stats and quest stages 
        of his sp 09 character and started a series from there ( channel is downthecrop2 ). He then decided since he knew some programming that he would take a crack at fixing bugs 
        he ran into. Later realizing that we have a promise to give save files he jumped over to live. He has contributed to both the Server and Website ( Drop table tool and Automation )
        and latest making a mobile client that can be found on the home page. Make sure to tell him hi he's super nice!

<h3>Moderators</h3>
<p id="leclerc"><img height="100" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/staff_images/leclerc.webp" style="border:black 1px solid; border-radius: 50%; " width="100"/> <b>Leclerc</b>
    <br/> 
    <br> 
    Leclerc is the discord & moderator of 2009scape. He came over from OpenRSC to play some good ol RS2. He is super friendly and is willing to go the extra mile to help you out. 
    If you need any help ingame like advice or what is what he is the one to go talk to. 
    <br/>

<h3>Retired Developers</h3>
<p id="sparrow"><img height="100" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/staff_images/sparrow.webp" width="100"/> <b>Sparrow</b>
<br/>
<br>

       He is an ex developer that slowly moved out of the role when we separated from 06rebotted's discord into our own. He has done some work but mainly with 
       the discord bots. If you would like to say hi he wouldn't mind.

<p id="dan">
<img height="100" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/staff_images/dan.webp" style="border:black 1px solid; border-radius: 50%;" width="100"/> <b>Dan</b>
<br/> 
<br>

    Dan was given Developer role for the massive amount of client updates. He has his own project going OpenNXT, but mainly works on his minecraft server that he does 
    for a living. 

    </p>
<br/>
<br/>



     Keep in mind that our staff team are all volunteer and are not paid for their customer service. 

     Rule #2 of our server is to not disrespect any staff member. While it's not severe for instant ban it is bannable if continued over and over.

     We're here to build an amazing server and help anyone with any questions they may have of our server. Do not ping a developer unless you are unable to login 

     Thanks 

      Staff Team
