### Jagex Does it Again - The Jagex Launcher on Linux

Taken from the [latest Jagex Launcher on Linux](https://help.jagex.com/hc/en-gb/articles/13413514881937-Downloading-the-Jagex-Launcher-on-Linux) FAQ:

> How to install the Jagex Launcher using Linux.

> **The Jagex launcher and Jagex Accounts will not be supported on the Linux OS.**

> If you wish to continue playing on a Linux machine you will have to use a mechanism that enables Windows applications to operate. There are community projects available that you can try such as:

> [TormStorm's jagex-launcher-linux project](https://github.com/TormStorm/jagex-launcher-linux) on GitHub

> This Reddit thread in r/2007scape discusses the process

> A YouTube guide by c00k

Right..

**A Real FAQ**

- What's the easiest way to use the Jagex launcher on Linux?
  
  Use the unofficial <a href="https://github.com/Adamcake/Bolt">Bolt</a> launcher - it handles everything for you!

- Can you convert back to a normal account?
  
  No, it's a one-way conversion.
  
- Does the Jagex launcher work on Linux?
  
  Yes, but it may break: <a href="https://github.com/TormStorm/jagex-launcher-linux">github.com/TormStorm/jagex-launcher-linux</a>

-  Does the Jagex Launcher enhance security?
  
  Yes, but if Jagex's primary motive was security, they would have made passwords case-sensitive, allowed bank pins on login, and made it so bank pins can't be disabled  in less time than it takes to reach Customer Support
  
- What's the real reason for the launcher?
  
  It likely has to do with them reducing risk by removing power from the community, as they're <a href="https://forum.2009scape.org/viewtopic.php? p=3080-jagex-being-sold-again-2023#p3080">trying to be sold</a> again.
  
- Does the Jagex Launcher stop bots?
  
  Given bot clients are compatible with the launcher, and <a href="https://forum.2009scape.org/viewtopic.php?p=3092-jagex-being-sold-again-2023#p3092">overwhelming evidence</a> that Jagex doesn't care about bots, the answer is no.

With the launcher being optional, some people say it's not a big deal. They would be
correct, until you log out - at which point you get a free conversion!

**History**

Despite Andrew Gower running the original Runescape servers on Linux, despite Java being designed for cross-architecture compatibility, despite 21 years of Runescape being playable on Linux and *BSDs, Jagex has finally pulled support for non-Windows and MacOS operating systems.

**Our Opinion**

While Jagex is hard at work making the game harder to play for new users, downthecrop has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7XzV2OYPiA">expirimenting</a> with bringing back webclients for Rs2.
Crazy what proper motives can do!

Jagex has continuously blundered their way through hosting Runescape, and the community has saved it each time.
While we are disappointed in Jagex's decision, we understand how profit driven companies work.
The 2009scape team is grateful for the community that provides Linux support natively to people who want to play Runescape.
In particular, we would like to give a shoutout to the following projects:

- [OpenRSC](https://rsc.vet/) - 2001 & 2003 remake - Native Linux + Flatpak support
- [2004scape](http://2004scape.org/) - 2004 remake - Native browser support
- [2011scape](http://2011scape.com/) - 2011 remake - Native Linux support
- [Darkan](http://darkan.org/) - 2012 remake - Native Linux + Snap support
