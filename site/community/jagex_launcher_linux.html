                              What's the easiest way to use the Jagex launcher on Linux?
                              <li>Use the unofficial <a href="https://github.com/Adamcake/Bolt">Bolt</a> launcher - it handles everything for you!

                              Can you convert back to a normal account?
                              <li>No, it's a one-way conversion.
                              </li>
                              <br>
                              Does the Jagex launcher work on Linux?
                              <li>Yes, but it may break: <a

                              Does the Jagex Launcher enhance security?
                              <li>
                                Yes, but if Jagex's primary motive was security, they would have made passwords
                                case-sensitive, allowed
                                bank pins on login, and made it so bank pins can't be disabled in less time than it

                              What's the real reason for the launcher?
                              <li>It likely has to do with them reducing risk by removing power from
                                the
                                community, as they're <a

                            With the launcher being optional, some people say it's not a big deal. They would be
                            correct, until you log out - at which point you get a free conversion!

                            Despite Andrew Gower running the original Runescape servers on Linux, despite Java being
                            designed for cross-architecture compatibility, despite 21 years of Runescape being
                            playable on Linux and *BSDs, Jagex has finally pulled support non-Windows and MacOS
                            operating systems.

                            While Jagex is hard at work making the game harder to play for new users, downthecrop has

                            Jagex has continuously blundered their way through hosting Runescape, and the community
                            has
                            saved it each time. While we are disappointed in Jagex's decision, we understand
                            how profit driven companies work.

                            the community that provides Linux support natively to people who want to play Runescape.
