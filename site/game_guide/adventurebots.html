                                                                        Everytime you tried to chop trees one would be there to steal it. While they were quite annoying they 
                                                                        did provide a lot of raw material to the ge that you might have believed players had collected but the 
                                                                        bulk of it was thanks to bots. Botting did make the game feel a lot less lonely due to collecting all 
                                                                        all the loot but never speaking to with you or they out right just out ranked you in the leaderboards. 
                                                                    </p>

                                                                        adventure bots. They are server sided bots that go out on <b>Adventures</b> as their name suggests. What is 
                                                                        really cool is they sell items they collect on their adventures to the grand exchange. Being a remake rsps 
                                                                        we will always have a lower playerbase and with this collection you will be able to play the game without the

                                                                        of dialogue they go through to add to the immersion. They will also talk directly to the player and their dialogue 
                                                                        shows up in the chat to add also to the immersion.

                                                                        they count down to christmas, and in the future possibly throw snow balls at the players or each other. They continue
