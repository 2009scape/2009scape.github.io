    Bots! They were everywhere when we played the game. It at times made the game feel lonely and other times 
    it was just outright annoying! especially when they stole your tree that you're chopping. Regardless of 
    how annoyed you got with them deep down they were still part of your childhood game. It is no secret that 
    2009scape is aimed around a forever mindset. What this means is that it is geared to outlive our live server.
    Loneliness can happen both on Live and SP mode.  
</p>

<p> 

    Well, you are in luck! 2009scape, unlike other servers, have bots that inhabit the world. All different types, but 
    in this page we're going to discuss one particular bots called <b><i>Adventure Bots</i></b>

<p>  
 <b>Immersion</b> 
 <br>
 <br>
 As I stated before the game gets lonely. The live has a lower player base and singleplayer is just you. While we sometimes 
 have the best conversation with our ownselves? (no? just me?) it can feel like an empty world. Adventure bots go on adventures 
 as the name suggests. They wander in a bunch of locations where you wouldn't expect. 
 <br>
 <br>

<b>Exchange</b>
<br>
<br>

As I stated the bots run around 2009scape going on Adventures. In their Adventures they find trees to woodcut, monsters to kill, 
rocks to mine and fish to catch! They then in return sell to the grand exchange for an inflated price of 10% higher than the 
average price making the items super expensive but still creates an economy. Sounds bizzare! but with a forever kept in mind 
we are thinking about the singleplayer end or the lower player count remakes usually bring while planning these bots out. 
RS always had bots fill their economy tons of resources. 

<br>
<br>

<b>They can talk?</b>
<br>
<br>
The best part of the bots isn't the items they provide on the exchange. It is honestly the dialogue they say outloud. They have 
tons of dialogue and extra dialogue throughout the holidays. Here are some photos that can be found in the #bot-quotes channel 
in the official discord.
