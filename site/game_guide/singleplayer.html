                            <!-- I discuss the bits of our promise here. -->
                            <p>2009scape operates a live server so that players can come together as a community and
                              enjoy the game with eachother. Should there be any scenario in which we are forced to shut
                              down the live server, we <b>promise</b> that all player saves will be released to the
                              public alongside a fresh
                              build of singleplayer.
                              <br />
                              <br />
                              We here on the 2009scape staff firmly believe that each player's
                              save is
                              their own individual property, and we will gladly provide anyone's save at their request.
                              Even banned players can ask for their save, and we will happily provide (but we will not
                              import singleplayer saves to the official multiplayer server)
                            </p>

                              Yes, but it's difficult and
                              there's no guide for it. If you want to play with friends or family, we encourage the live
