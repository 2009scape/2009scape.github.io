<h3>Our Multiplayer Promise</h3>
<!-- I discuss the bits of our promise here. -->
<p>We here at 2009scape operate a live server so that players can come together as a community and enjoy the game with eachother. 
    Should there be any scenario in which we are forced to shut down the live server, we <b>promise</b> that all player saves will be released to the public alongside a fresh build of singleplayer.
    We here on the 2009scape staff firmly believe that each player's save is their own individual property, and we will gladly provide anyone's save at their request. 
    Even banned players can ask for their save, and we will happily provide. You can also view our Privacy policies <a href="../privacy/privacy.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Singleplayer</h3>

<b> Setting up Linux Singleplayer </b>

<ol>
<li>Download or clone this <a href="https://gitlab.com/2009scape/singleplayer/linux">repository</a>.</li>
<li>After you unpack the .zip (if you just downloaded it) or it finishes cloning (if you cloned it), open up the folder that it created. </li>
<li>In this folder there will be a run-linux.sh, execute this to start everything up. </li>
<li> What you need to do first before you can run the game is initialize the database. You only have to do this once. </li>
<li> Once that's finished, you can safely run the game with option 1. </li>
</ol>

<b> Setting up Windows Singleplayer </b>

<ol>
<li> Head over to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/2009scape/singleplayer/windows">repository</a>. </li>
<li>Find the big blue button that says "Clone".</li>
<li>Click the one to its left.</li>
<li>Select ZIP release.</li>
<li>Download & extract the ZIP to a directory of your liking - preferably desktop or something like that. Program Files likely won't work.</li>
<li>Execute launch.bat. Enjoy the game.</li>
</ol>

<br/>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>First launch will take a bit longer because the database will have to be properly configured.</li>
    <li>If you change internal server configuration and things suddenly start to be wonky - that's on you. The release is meant to be enjoyed as-is and any modifications to the server configuration files are your own.</li>
    <li><b>Make sure that you create back ups of your player save to avoid any issues with your save. As a singleplayer member you are responsible for your player backups.</b></li>
</ul>

<p> Of course, majority of the minigames do not require other players to play in the first place. We do have special pest control bots,
