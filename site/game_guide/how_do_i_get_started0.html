<p>   Welcome to 2009scape Legacy, the dream of the ages, where your memories of childhood Runescape come to life. Unlike Oldschool Runescape, we keep true to the Gower brothers'
  vision of the game while also adding our own little mix to it. So, you may be wondering what is the difference between this game and the jagex hosted servers. 
  Well you have come to the right place and I am glad to be your guide! To get started you make your account using the create an account button on the login screen 
  and follow it through. Once you have finished this part you are ready for your character creation. Here you will head to the next section to learn about the 
  different account types. 
  <br/>
<br/>
    In 2009scape, we are a constant work in progress, do keep this in mind and report any bugs you may find by opening an issue on our Gitlabs so it can be worked on 
  by the community. This project is working towards 100% completion state in our about page found <a href="./about2009scape.html">here</a>
  While we are remake we have a few functionalities that were not part of the 2009 client which we had added. You can find where all our controls are on the 
  controls page <a href="controls.html">here</a>.

  <br/>
<br/>
    After you have read the above please check out the rest of this guide as it has information on what is different inside of 2009scape currently 
  versus the real games. If you have any questions that are not answered here please ask away in discord if they're not already 
  on the website or in the <a href="../help/faq.html">FAQ</a>.

<span class="headertitleleft"><span class="headertitleright">Tutorial Island</span></span>
</div>
<br/>
<b>Tip : An easy way to get to Lumbridge court yard is the home teleport, but don't worry we do not have a cool down timer.</b> we are keeping this ingame for debugging. 
Since we are still in active development having a way for players to get unstuck is crucial. 
<br/>
<br/>
<p> Many players come in the game not knowing what to expect of how they can play the game. The nostalgic excitement can cause one to spam click buttons in the beginning causing you to miss the important starting message</p>
As of April 2022, Hans no longer gives the options for experience rate changes or ironman modes. The beautiful nostaligic Tutorial Island has landed on 2009scape's 
content chart. Now you are able to complete the tutorial island as you once were able to in the 2009. Worry not! if you have completed this tutorial one too many times 
or want to be a skiller you are able to skip the island at the very start by speaking to Skippy.

<br>
<br>
<b>WARNING: The default experience rate is x5 as mentioned below. If you are a skiller keep this in mind!</b>
<br/><br/>
<p><b> Changing xp rates </b></p>
<p> In 2009scape, we have a base rate xp as x5xp. This rate obviously can be changed using this option. </p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> x1xp Rate ( The Authentic RS rate that many desire who plan on making this their home )</li>
<li> x2.5xp Rate ( For those players who want the grind with some ease ) </li>
<li> x5xp Rate ( Stated before as being the base xp rate ) </li>
<li> x10xp Rate ( As of the New Year the new Hardcore Permadeath mode with a special xp rate choice of x10. )</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b> You can only change your xp rate once and you are able to only change it before reaching a total level of 50. </b>
<br/>
<p><b> Changing Ironman Modes </b></p>
<p> There are a select few who have come from Reddit and have not played the actual game in over a decade. So, I will go into detail with each mode. </p>
<ul>
<li> Ironman/IronWoman Mode </li>
<p> This account mode is the basic of the three account types. Ironmen/IronWomen are unable to trade any other player so they are completely self-sufficient. They also can not use lootshare
whatsoever which means they are still stuck collecting everything on their own. </p>
<li> Hardcore (Permadeath) Ironman/IronWoman Mode </li>
<p> Following the restrictions of regular Ironman/IronWoman mode, the Permadeath Ironmen/Ironwomen are locked to one life and the account will be 'reset' upon deletion.  </p>
<li> Ultimate Ironman/IronWoman </li>
<p> Like regular Ironman/IronWoman mode, the only other difference is ultimate Ironmen/IronWomen can not bank items. However, they can note items on bank booths and unnote the items. </p>
</ul>
<br/>
<div class="headings">
  <span class="headertitleleft"><span class="headertitleright" id="starter_items">Starter Items</span></span>
  </div>
  <br/>
  Due to the amount of people who would get stuck in this "loop" in the beginning of account creation we decided that to best combat this issue 
  we removed the starter items. This leaves a lot of players confused where to get these starter items since they've always had them in the beginning 
  on their Runescape adventures. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Bronze Axe</b> - The bronze axe can be found in the chicken coup across the bridge of Lumbridge across from the cows. It is 
  sticking in a tree stump for you to grab. <br>
  <b>Bronze Pickaxe</b> - The bronze pickaxe can be found by going up the ladder in the gate house in Lumbridge castle. It is located on the 
  third floor. <br>
  <b>Tinderbox</b> - The tinderbox can be found in the Draynor Manor on the third floor near the professor you speak to during the 
  Ernest the chicken quest. ( can also be bought from the general store for a few coins ) <br>
  <b>Fish Net</b> - The fish net can be found near the fishing tutor in Lumbridge swamp all over the ground. <br>
  <b>Knife</b> - A knife can be found on top of the crate in the Lumbridge Castle kitchen basement or behind Bob's Axe Shop. <br> 
  <b>Iron Dagger</b> - While the bronze dagger is usually the staple of the tutorial island weapons, an iron one is even better. You can find an iron dagger in the Goblin house
  across the bridge in Lumbridge.

<p> In Runescape there were plenty of different ways to make money and I know it's a tad difficult hopping into the time machine and coming back to this era forgetting how in the worlds people made money.
    Not to worry we have you covered with some basic money making methods that may later have full guides but for now a little glimpse into what 2009scape has to offer.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Tip: The Bandit Camp's General store buys items for high alch value if you are unable to find players to trade or do not have the magic level</b>
    <br>

<ul>
<p><b> Jobs </b> </p>
<img align="right" alt="" height="100" src="../img/main/kbase/getting_started/workfor.png" style="margin-left: 1%;" width="190"/>
<p align="left"> In the year of 2009, Runescape had a job system to help newer players get used to the skill system. You came right out the tutorial Learning the ropes, just to realize that you had 25gp to your name 
    with just a few starter tools to get you started. Most of the tutors inside of Lumbridge are trying to get you to work for them but I know right away that can be intimidating.
    If I were you, I would head straight to the woodcutting tutors and get your first job. While you are level one woodcutting you will most likely have to cut 
    around 20 regular logs and give you around 5-6k. 
</p>
<br/>
<p> <b> Pyramid Plunder </b></p>
<p> This sneaky thieving mini game can end up getting you a pretty penny when first starting. As it only requires 30 thieving to get started!
There are plenty of rewards to get form the mini game one being pharaoh's sceptre.

<p> <b> Agility Pyramid </b></p>
<p> You will need a way to make sure you don't die of the desert heat and a minimum of 30 agility to get started. 
    The pyramid is straight-forward and when you bring Simon the pyramid top he will give you 10k each. 
    <br/>
<br/>
<b> Make sure you bring waterskins</b>
<br/>
</p><p> <b> Stronghold of Security </b></p>
<p> Make your way over to the stronghold of security underneath the Barbarian village. Make your way through the mazes answering the player safety questions 
Once you have made it through the maze there is a free 10k and some colorful/fighting boots with your name on it </p>

</div>
<br/>
<p><b> Gnome Gliders </b></p>
<p> One of the biggest obstacles of Runescape in 2009, was attempting to go over the white wolf mountain or you could
walk all the way to edgeville pull the wilderness lever, pull it again and end up in Ardy. Tree gnome stronghold is not 
implemented in the game yet so we consider the glider free game for those who want to use it. You have several locations 
you can teleport to right away. 
<br/>
<br/>
<img alt="" height="150" src="../img/main/kbase/getting_started/gnomeGlider.PNG" width="330"/>
<br/>
<b>Note: This will be removed once the quest is implemented</b> </p>
<br/>
<p><b> Spirit Trees </b></p>
<p> Just like the Gnome Gliders, the Spirit Trees are unlocked as of right now because Tree gnome village quest is not 
implemented yet! </p>
<img alt="" height="150" src="../img/main/kbase/getting_started/treegnome.PNG" width="350"/>
<p><b> Note: This will be removed once the quest is implemented </b></p>
<br/>
<p><b> Canoes </b></p>
<p> The travel method a lot of people forget about are the canoes! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<img height="300" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/canoe_system.png" style="border : solid 3px black;" width="300"/>
</p>
<p><b> Fairy Rings </b></p>
<p> I won't be going into super detail of where the fairy rings teleport you to, but I will say that
in 2009scape due to Fairy tale quest not being added, the fairy rings are locked behind only the lost city quest.
</p>

</div>
<p><b> Quests </b> </p>
<p> One major thing that most people on the server forget when starting the server is that quests exist in the game. 
    While most rsps do not really have quests this is a remake of the year 2009 so the plan is to add all the quests eventually
    in the game. As pointed out earlier on this page is that when a quest is not implemented you can use some of the travel methods 
    without needing to complete the quest. You can find all the quests inside the website under quest help. 
    The quest cape works as well. Once a new quest is added you will no longer be able to wear the cape until that quest is completed. 
</p>
<br/>
<p> <b> Diaries </b></p>
<p> Recently we had an update that added the Diaries to the game! There is now certain content locked
behind these achievements. With methods of fast traveling completing the Lumbridge/Draynor diaries can land you an explorer
ring which teleports you to the farming patches! There are plenty of other perks of completing the diaries! So click the little
green star in your quests tab to check them out! </p>
<br/>
<p> <b> Dailies </b></p>
<p> With a new system for Dailies being added the dailyscape grind has come to 09. Do not worry, this will not consume your entire gameplay experience 
  since there is plenty of stuff to do inside of the game. Just to name a few dailies there are shooting stars, penguin hide n seek, and 
  things like battlestaves being in stock. There will be guides soon on our local <a href="https://cdn.2009scape.org/wiki/doku.php?id=start">Wiki</a>. </p>
<br/>
<p> <b> Slayer Rerolls </b></p>
<p> Being a Community we are always voting in Quality of life updates that help players releive a partial bit of the tedious unnecessary grind of their 
  game play experience. In 2009scape, we have allowed as long as you are within the dialogue to reroll the slayer task. If you click out 
  the game has noted that you had accepted the slayer task.
</p>

<p> <b>Dragon Scimitar</b></p>
<p>You are able to grab a dragon scimitar from Ape Atol by using the teleport. You do not need monkey madness in order to get the dragon scimmy. Do note that 
  this option will changed once the quest itself is added.
</p>

<p><b>Fun Costumes</b></p>
<p>You can pick up a variety of holiday items by talking to Diango in Draynor Village; however, you will need to earn credits in order to get the ultra 
  rare holiday items such as party hats. <a href="./credits.html">Read more here</a>
</p>
