  Our Credit system is our Reward system for contributing towards the project in various ways. Do not confuse it with a 
  donation system that another server may have. We wanted to give credits a meaning by adding a special shop (using the ::shop 
  command to access it) that sold the common holiday item rares such as the santa, bunny ears, etc..

<b><u>Voting</u></b>
<p> Everyone who has been actively a part of discord understands that this may be by far the easiest way to earn 
  a credit. All you need to do in order to get a credit is vote on Rune locus. You may ask yourself the question 
  why do we want you to vote? how does this help us? The higher we get on the list the more exposure we may get to 
  get more players in return this helps contribute to building the server. You can find the link for the voting website in the 
  handy links section of discord. Once you've voted, take a screenshot of your page, and then post inside of the #claim-to-fame section of Discord.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  After you have voted you will receive a total of one credit every 12 hours so this method could easily earn you an average
  of 60 credits a month. In March of 2021 we have introduced a new system called our voting streak system which if a player 
  has voted for seven consecutive days you will recieve five credits for your first vote on your seventh day. Once you've 
  earned the streak it starts over at day one for you to get it again the following week by voting all week again. Keep in 
  mind for the voting streak you only need to vote once a day. We are based off of California time for how I'm reporting days. 
  This might mean for people over seas that your end of the day will not be California's end of the day therefore you will 
  still have a bit more time for you to vote. If you miss a day of voting your voting streak will be reset and you will need 
  to vote seven days in a row all over again.
</p>
<b><u> Hall of Fame </u></b>
<p> Ah yes, we have made it to the pride and joy of a game where our accomplishments are not only rewarded by a fantastic skill cape 
or bragging rights, but also can claim your right to the first to a 99 in a skill and get credits and recognition on our website for 
their achievements. It is determined by different different experience rates and ironman modes to determine how many credits someone
may get. 
<br> 
These Hall of fame rewards were completely rewritten to fit the amount of effort one puts into their account.
<ul>
<li><b>x1 xp rate</b>: 200 credits</li>
<li><b>x2.5 xp rate</b>: 100 credits</li>
<li><b>x5 xp rate</b>: 40 credits</li>
<li><b>x10 xp rate</b>: 20 credits ( For Permadeath Ironmen only )</li>

</ul>
</p>
<b><u> JSON Contributions </u></b>
<p>
The little things matter and they add up super quickly! Json additions add so much immersion to the game by making sure things 
are authentic to the era. You used to have to manually type it in and make edits the old fashion way. Luckily there is a tool that 
was created by Ceikry to speed this process up. Click on the <a href="https://gitlab.com/2009scape/tools/rs09-thanos-tool">Thanos Tool</a> to be redirected to the Gitlab page.

</p>
<b><u> Quest Dialogue </u></b>
<p>
  2008/2009 era was quite awhile away but luckly some youtubers still have quite a bit of video guides in which you can pull dialogue from. 
  The problem with using Osrs for quest guides is Osrs had so many subtle changes that it is hard to tell sometimes what was changed and 
  what wasn't. Writing Dialogue is extremely tedious and for this the reward is 10 credits per dialogue file written. Ask in the #development 
  channel in discord where to begin.
</p>

<b><u>Testing Content</u></b>
<p>
  With our new test server, we are able to test content on a server to make sure bugs do not enter the realm of the live server. We 
  can but do not want to do this alone and would love the help! But don't worry, there is something in it for you. Credits! Keep 
  in mind that credits will only be awarded to people who thoroughly test the content and provide detailed reports on them. Like 
  votes or HoF you must claim them inside of the #claim-to-fame channel on discord or matrix.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you test smaller things like bug fixes there is a 2 credit reward. <br>
  If you test full quests or minigames you will be rewarded 5 credits. <br> 
   If you find a bug in the content you are testing that hasn't already been found you will earn 
  an extra credit. <br> 
  <br> Super Easy! Get to testing!
</p>

<b><u> Events </u></b>
<p>
  To keep Community events alive we spark it up with some credits for attending. If you attend the event and participate you get a total of 2 points even 
  if you lose! Kermit, our event manager, gets to give out more credits to the winners of an official event. Once a week a player is able to make an 
  unofficial event and get 5 credits for hosting their own. It must be approved in order to get credits.
