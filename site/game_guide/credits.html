                                                                    As many of you know Credits are 100% exclusive to 2009scape. But what are credits you ask?
                                                                    Credits are the 2009scape's currency for rare items. Is it like a donator shop? With it's own 
                                                                    custom interface you won't be mistaken that it has anything to do with any custom private server.
                                                                    Credits are our way of saying thank you for doing something. I'm going to go over all the different 
                                                                    methods of earning credits. 

                                                                    <img height="300" src="../2009scape-resources/img/game_guide/menu.png" style="margin-left: 13%; margin-top: 1%;" width="500"/>

<b><u>Voting</u></b>
<p> Everyone who has been actively a part of discord understands that this may be by far the easiest way to earn 
                                                                    a credit. All you need to do in order to get a credit is vote on Rune locus. You may ask yourself the question 
                                                                    why do we want you to vote? how does this help us? The higher we get on the list the more exposure we may get to 
                                                                    get more players in return this helps contribute to building the server. Every so often our discord bot will post 
                                                                    the link to vote but if it hasn't and you'd like the link just use the command ::vote inside of discord. 
                                                                    Once you've voted, take a screenshot of your page, and then post inside of the #claim-to-fame section of Discord.
                                                                    <br/>

                                                                    After you have voted you will receive a total of one credit every 12 hours so this method could easily earn you an average
                                                                    of 60 credits a month. In March of 2021 we have introduced a new system called our voting streak system which if a player 
                                                                    has voted for seven consecutive days you will recieve five credits for your first vote on your seventh day. Once you've 
                                                                    earned the streak it starts over at day one for you to get it again the following week by voting all week again. Keep in 
                                                                    mind for the voting streak you only need to vote once a day. We are based off of California time for how I'm reporting days. 
                                                                    This might mean for people over seas that your end of the day will not be California's end of the day therefore you will 
                                                                    still have a bit more time for you to vote. If you miss a day of voting your voting streak will be reset and you will need 
                                                                    to vote seven days in a row all over again.
                                                                </p>
<b><u> Hall of Fame </u></b>
<p> Ah yes, we have made it to the pride and joy of a game where our accomplishments are not only rewarded by a fantastic skill cape 
                                                                  or bragging rights but also can claim your right to the first to a 99 in a skill and get credits and recognition on our website for 
                                                                their achievements. It is determined by different different experience rates and ironman modes to determine how many credits someone
                                                                may get.

                                                                  exploit the game by reading the code making it so we now needed to close source the live. This does not mean that 
                                                                  our drop tables and spawns are not able to be seen or worked on. If you work on spawn rates, drop lists, or item spawns
                                                                  you will be rewarded with 10 credits per 100 changed lines. In order to do this you will need to go into

                                                                  improve the game by getting it closer to authenticity of 2009 and you are saving developers time for adding content in the game.

                                                                    youtubers who have videos from 2008-2009 where you can see the dialogue word for word through their chat options. This is the

                                                                    this incase OSRS has changed something and didn't document it well. By doing this you are speeding up the developer's time by
