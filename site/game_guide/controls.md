In 2023, unlike the old days before, you will need to get client plugins to do things we once could do without.
In your launcher, you will see options to install plugins.
The plugin that you are going to want for the majority of these will be "BasicInputQoL".
To learn more about the Client Plugins, click [here](./client-plugins.html).
