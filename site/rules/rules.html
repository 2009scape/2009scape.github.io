  <p> I know that not everyone uses Discord and some rely on the website for their information or 
    some do use our matrix bridge in order to keep in contact. However, we haven't established what
    the overall rules are of the server outside of the Discord. So the following Rules were made by 
    Ceikry and written by Cazrep. I am just rewriting onto the website now.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;"> <img src="../2009scape-resources/img/rules/runecraft_symbol.png"> Welcome to 2009scape <img src="../2009scape-resources/img/rules/runecraft_symbol.png"></h2>
  <p style="margin-left: 3%;">
  <b>We hope you enjoy your stay. Before you get started, please read and agree to the following rules:</b>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 3%;">
    </p><h4><b><u>Treat everyone in the community with respect.</u></b></h4>
  Any disrespect, demeaning comments or harassment to members, moderators, staff and developers, inside  2009scape or its respective discord server, will not be tolerated.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b> Sexual harrassment is bannable without appeal.</b>
  <p></p>
  <br>
  <p style="margin-left: 3%;">
  
  </p><h4><b><u>WE DO NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR PERSONAL / PRIVATE MULTIPLAYER SERVERS </u></b></h4>
  <b>This is your first and final notice. </b> 
  <br>
  <br>
  Any questions directed to staff in either #live-server-help  or #singleplayer-help  related to personal or private multiplayer servers is a failure to adhere to this rule and will result in an immediate ban. 
  <p></p>
  <p>
    </p><h4><b><u>Duplication or exploitation of bugs is bannable on first offense  </u></b></h4>
    If you find a bug, immediately report it to the form linked in #bug-report. Unreported bugs not only degrade the quality of the game but also compromises the integrity of the community. Your accounts will be deleted and your IP will be blacklisted.
  <p></p>
  <p style="margin-left: 3%;">
    </p><h4><b><u>Third Party botting is a bannable offence</u></b></h4>
    From now on while the bot scripts are being maintained the bot scripts will remain in game. Any third bot program will result in being banned. Our bot scripts 
    remove you from the leaderboards and prevent you from trading other accounts of yours to make sure it's fair gameplay across the board for everyone.
  
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Autoclickers</b> and <b>macros</b> will also qualify as botting  First and final warning. <br> <br>
  <i><b>Remember: Any activity in 2009scape is closely monitored for violations of these rules.</b></i>
  
  <p></p>
  If you have any questions, be sure to check <a href="">FaQ</a> FIRST, there are a ton of common issues that can be quickly resolved with the information provided.
  <br>
  <br>
  If you still can not get your question resolved, feel free to hit up the appropriate live-server-help  or singleplayer-help  channel for assistance. 
  <b>The live server help section is accessible through matrix as well for you anti-discord users.</b>
  <br>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;"><i>Do not direct message any staff member for help as this <b>will</b> further delay our response times</i></p>
  
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Failure to follow these rules:</h3>
  
  
  <p style="font-size: 12px;">
    <b>First Offence: </b> This is your written warning from Staff. <br>
  <b>Second Offence: </b> You will be kicked from the server or discord. <br>
  <b> Three Strikes You're Out: </b> You will be ip banned from the server/discord.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The rules in place are not here for <i>just</i> incase scenarios. People have violated these terms before so the rules are in place for this reason.
