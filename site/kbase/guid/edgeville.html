Just north of Edgeville is the Wilderness, a lawless place where monsters lurk and vicious spirits of the long-dead can rise up without warning. If you intend to go into the Wilderness you should be aware that you will probably be attacked by a number of monsters, so it is best to take only items you are willing to lose.
<br><br>
Also be aware that some players may try to lure you into the Wilderness in order to get you killed by the many aggressive monsters, so be on your guard and make sure you're watching your screen if you are in Edgeville.

Living life on the edge
</div>

Edgeville is a popular resort town close to the balmy lands of the Wilderness. Well, it would be if the Wilderness were a resort rather than a land governed by no nation and few rules. Being so close to the Wilderness can make Edgeville a dangerous place to wander about, as a wrong step can be a fatal mistake.
<br><br>
The town itself is very small by any standards, but it is a rather convenient members' transport hub in the lands of RuneScape. Amulets of Glory will quickly deposit players at the bank, who may then choose to travel onwards using the canoe point across the river, or, if they have completed <a href="a_fairy_tale_part_ii_cure_a_queen_members.html">Fairy Tale II - Cure a Queen</a>, by making use of the oh-so-convenient fairy rings.

Location of Edgeville
</div>

Edgeville sits at the top of Misthalin, in the north-west corner. Directly south is the <a href="barbarian_village.html">Barbarian Village</a>, where some residue of old RuneScape still survives. South-east and east is <a href="varrock.html">Varrock</a>, the capital, the closest point of which is the Grand Exchange, just over the river.
<br><br>
To the west of the town is the Monastery, where injured adventurers will find monks willing to heal them - a useful service for those who went into the Wilderness without being properly prepared. With the construction of the ditch to prevent the incursion of Wilderness monsters, a safe path to the Monastery has been created for adventurers and residents of Edgeville alike.

Edgeville's points of interest
</div>

The most important feature in Edgeville must be the bank. No other bank sits so close to the edge of the Wilderness, nor so convenient to a common teleport site, so it is a great assistance to adventurers looking to stash their most prized valuables, or to retrieve their preferred weapon.
<br><br>
Aside from this, there is Oziach, who makes runite platebodies, green dragonhide body armour and can smith the draconic visage onto anti-dragonbreath shields for a fee. Members will find the Mage of Zamorak to the north of town, just inside the Wilderness, who will teleport them to the Abyss provided they have <a href="the_abyss.html">given him some assistance</a>...
<br><br>
Of course, no description of Edgeville would be complete without mentioning the vault of extreme evil and DOOM that lies beneath it, open for any member to see. Yes, Edgeville is home to Evil Dave, possibly the most wicked and evil human to roam RuneScape - his cruelty only matched by his reluctance to do anything <i>actually</i> evil.
<br><br>
Also beneath the town, and possibly almost as evil as Evil Dave's Basement of DOOM, are the depths of <a href="edgeville_dungeon.html">Edgeville Dungeon</a>.

Evil Dave has always been different from other boys. When he built a treehouse it was his Tower of Fear; when he went to play in Edgeville Dungeon it was not to be a hero, but to be a monster; and now he lives in his mother's basement, the BASEMENT OF DOOM! He has been working on summoning legions of demons and the undead, but has so far only managed to afflict his basement with a plague of hell rats, who are more sulphurous than evil.
